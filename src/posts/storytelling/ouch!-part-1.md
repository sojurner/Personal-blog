## Overview

Back in 2017, I was the victim of a hit and run. I suffered major injuries that took many months of therapy to recover. Here's my story.

## The Incident

To provide some context, I had recently left the US Army and was attending university.

On the night of the incident, there were two things to note:

- I had an evening class that lasted til 8pm.

- I had a midterm test the next morning, which I wasn't prepared for.

I knew I was in for a long night of studying. So after the night class had ended, I went to get some food a couple miles from campus, and made my way back to my apartment.

Parking was difficult to find that night, so I ended up settling on some street parking about half a mile from the residence.

I parked my car and got out with my backpack and food in my hands. This was the last memory I could recall, because the next moment after, I found myself waking up on hospital bed choking on an [endotracheal tube](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK539747/).

> Apparently, I had been unconcious for a couple hours. It was as if I had entered a portal and teleported in time to a hospital. The experience was surreal.

My body was unnoticeable. My legs were were covered in bloodied bandages and throbbing with aches. The left part of my face was stiff as it was covered in patches of dried blood. There was a distinctive pain on my left hand. Apparently, it was nerve damage. My fingers felt as though they were being lit under a constant, *blazing fire*.

I had suffered an *open compound fracture* on my left tibia and a *closed fracture* on my right. Metal rods were inserted in both legs through a procedure called [Intramedullary Nailing](https://orthoinfo.aaos.org/en/diseases--conditions/tibia-shinbone-shaft-fractures/#:~:text=Intramedullary%20nailing.&text=During%20this%20procedure%2C%20a%20specially,in%20proper%20position%20during%20healing.).

The reality of the situation started to sink in. I knew overcoming this was going to be my biggest challenge yet.

## What Happened?

After I'd gathered my bearings, i had plenty of questions that needed answers...

#### **"What in the world happened?"**

- Unfortunately, nobody had a clear response. The only reliable information was from an eye witness testimony: A black SUV traveling 40-50 mph had struck me and fled the scene immediately afterwards. It was a hit and run.

#### **"Will I be able walk/run again?"**

- Yes, with therapy and proper care, full recovery should be expected.

#### **"How long will that be?"**

- 2 weeks - slow walk with assistance
- 1 month - unassisted slow walk
- 2 months - back to normal walk
- 3 months - slow jog
- 4 months - 90-100% recovery

#### **"What about my test?"**

- Your blood tests came back normal. Nothing to worry about there.

#### **"No, I meant my midterm test"**

- ...your midterm test? Well, you're in no condition to be taking a test. You'll be here for least a week. Your focus should be recovery.

#### *So ... no test?*

They say every cloud has a silver lining ..... *I'll take it*.
