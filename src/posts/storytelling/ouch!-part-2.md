**If you haven't read part 1, none of this is going to make any sense. So, head on over there before continuing!**

## Recap

I had sustained serious injuries as a result of a hit and run. A long road to recovery was ahead.

## The first week

First week was one of the worst I'd experienced. Nerve damage on my left hand was a fiery pain that kept me up at night. My brittle legs only allowed for one or two sleeping positions, which led to incredible discomfort. Nothing about the week was enjoyable.

My limited mobility made simple and routine tasks 10x more difficult. Stuff you'd never think twice about, such as getting water, going to the bathroom, and changing clothes were near impossible without assistance.

I would first experience the restrictive nature of my situation through the **Bedpan**.

## The Bedpan

During this week, I had consumed loads of pain meds and as a result, was unable to "do my busineess". It wasn't until day four, when the buildup had reached its critical mass, and there was no where left for it but (pun intended) out.

However, there was a problem. I was virtually glued to my hospital bed. It had only been a few days since surgery, and consequently, couldn't lift my legs. This meant using the restroom was not possible. My only option was the **Bedpan**.

Another limitation I had that would play a role in this situation was that I couldn't sit upright. The furthest sitting angle I could achieve was about 140Â°. As you can imagine, thats practically a straight line.

The first aspect of the challenge was getting the bedpan under my ass. Because of the nerve damage on my left hand, it was motorless. Doing this with only my right arm was difficult, but at this point I had no other choice. My pride was too fragile for a nurse to get involved. It was essential that I did this unassisted.

Eventually, with grit & determination (and perhaps out of desparation), I was able to get the bedpan underneath. All that was left to do was the actual act.

As I began this portion of the challenge, I wondered, "How hard and how long am I going to have to push?".

Unfortunately, the answer would be **"Yes"**.

The awkward sitting position, straight stiff legs, and 3+ days of constipation made it whimsically difficult. No matter how hard I tried pushing, it fought back effortlessly.  Any effort attempts to adjust my sitting position to help push harder, was struck down by semi-paralysis.  It felt like I was running in place for the first couple minutes.

After what seemed to be hours (probably a couple minutes), it finally started to give in. I began to see the light at the end of the tunnel. Now, all that was left needed was the setup.  I gave some minor heaves to push it as close to the door as possible.  It was finally ready for the coup de grace...

I exhaled...I was rewarded with release.

My body was drenched in sweat and the tears of remorse lined my cheeks.

I took a glance inside the bedpan.

No amount of adjectives could properly justify its size and enormity. I was in awe.

The nurse swung by to collect the bedpan. As she picked it up, her eyes dilated. Oddly, she curious enough to take a peek.  She, immediately shot me a look.

I returned it with a proud smile.

I reflect back on that day every now and then. Almost always, I'm left feeling regret.
Regret that I didn't take a picture.
