**If you haven't read part 1, none of this is going to make any sense. So, head on over there before continuing!**

## Recap

I had sustained serious injuries as a result of a hit and run. A long road to recovery was ahead.

## The first week

First week was one of the worst I'd experienced.  It was constant, relentless pain. Nerve damage on my left hand was a screaming pain that kept me up at night. My brittle legs only allowed for one or two sleeping positions, which led to incredible discomfort. Nothing about the week was enjoyable.

My limited mobility made simple and routine tasks 10x more difficult. 
Stuff you'd never think twice about, such as getting water, going to the bathroom, and changing clothes were near impossible without assistance.  

I would first experience the restrictive nature of my situation through the **Bedpan**.

## The Bedpan

During this week, I had consumed loads of pain meds and as a result, was unable to "do my busineess". It wasn't until day 4, the buildup had reached its critical mass and had no where else to go but out.

However, there was a problem. I was virtually glued to my hospital bed. It had only been a couple days since surgery, and so, I couldn't lift my legs off the bed. Unfortunately, using a restroom was not possible. My only option was the **Bedpan**.

Another limitation I had that would play a role in this scenario, was that I couldn't sit upright. The furthest sitting angle I could achieve was about 140Â°.  As you can imagine, thats practically a straight line.

The first aspect of the challenge was getting the bedpan under my ass.  Because of the nerve damage on my left hand, my left arm was useless.  Doing this with just my right arm, was difficult, but possible.  
At this point, my pride was too fragile for a nurse to get involved. It was essential that I did this unassisted.

With grit and prideful determination, I was eventually able to get the bedpan underneath. All that was left to do was the actual act.  

My initial thought: "How hard and how long am I going to have to push?". Unfortunately, the answer would be " Yes ". 

The awkward sitting position, straight stiff legs, and 3+ days of constipation would equate to a battle for the ages. No matter how hard I did push, it fought back by saying " no ".  

After what seemed to be hours (probably a couple minutes), it finally gave in (or i should say gave out), and I was victorious. 

My body was drenched in sweat and tears of pain.  
I took a glance inside the bedpan. 

Words couldn't describe the enormity of my creation. It was truly a spectacle. A Randy Marsh sized crap.  

I rang for the nurse to collect the bedpan. As she picked it up, her eyes doubled in size.  She took a peek and quickly gave me a look gave me a look.  
I returned it with a proud smile.

I think back to that day every now and then.  When i do, I'm left with a feeling of regret.  
Regret that I didn't take a picture.
