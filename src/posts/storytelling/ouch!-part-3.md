## The recovery

Like many peers of my generation, I've struggled with depression throughout my life.  
How I would manage and overcome this situation was a big question mark to my family, friends, and most importantly to my self.

for the next four months. A normal casual day for the average person was a tireless grind for me.

Time seemed to slow down, and most of my days were spent alone, lying on my bed.
Thoughts that I had neglected from the normal day to day work/school life began to surface.

Who am I? Who do you want to be? What do you like/dislike about yourself?  
Why'd you come back home?  You don't even like it here.  
Are you happy? What is happiness? Who are your friends?

The irony of my situation: What almost killed me ended up saving my life.
