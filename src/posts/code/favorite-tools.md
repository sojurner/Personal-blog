## Intro

Plenty of amazing & free tools/resources out there available for developers.  Here are some of my favorites.  

## VS Code

This is a no-brainer for front-end developers. If you're a dev, and have never heard of VS Code, I strongly advise lifting that rock over your head.

I can go into details of the features and benefits of VS Code, but frankly, I wouldn't be able to do it justice. Not to mention, it would take forever.

All I can say, is [try it out](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and see for yourself.

## Postman

     style="border-radius: 10px; height: 150px;" />

Postman is a popular API client for devs to create, share, test and document APIs. They provide a slew of features that help facilitate every step of the API development process.  

Most likely, you'll be using Postman or another similar collaborative API service at your job. So, if you're an upcoming dev, I'd advise [trying it out](https://www.postman.com/) and getting acquainted. 

## Brave

     alt="Brave logo"
     style="border-radius: 10px; height: 150px;" />
This is my main, go-to web browser. For me, the main selling point is its built-in ad block feature.  In my opinion, this is should be a default for any web browser. Tied with the ad blocker, is their rewards program that incentivizes private ad viewership in exchange for BAT coins!

If you're searching for a more privacy based web browser, then Brave is not going to be it.  Brave is built off of Google's Chromium software, so security/privacy will be second-class features.

To view their entire feature list head over to [Brave's feature page](https://brave.com/features/).

## Openbase

     style="border-radius: 10px; height: 150px;" />

Openbase is a fantastic web app where users can learn, discover, and rate open-source NPM projects.  Personally, I'm a fan of the clean and futuristic UI.  

The sheer amount of information and data it provides is enormous.  I always feel I'm getting a complete picture of the entire npm ecosystem.

I encourage everyone to [check it out](https://openbase.io/)!

## Mockaroo

     alt="Mockaroo logo"
     style="border-radius: 10px; height: 150px;" />

Mockaroo is a mock data generator website that supports CSV, JSON, SQL, and Excel formats. Its straightfoward and easy for anyone to use, even without a programming background.

For me, its most attractive feature is the expansive list of category types to choose from. Example of some types include: Company Name, Phone number, SSN, Drug Name, etc. 

Check out their [website](https://www.mockaroo.com/) to see the full list and start mocking!

## Today I Learned ( HashRocket )

TIL is a great learning resource for programmers.  Simply put, its one large series of informative, code-related blog posts. 

Each post is short & concise, and topics can range anywhere from languages & frameworks to tools & tips/tricks.

[Head on over there and start learning!](https://til.hashrocket.com/)

## Iconify

If you're a cheap-ass like myself, [Iconify](https://iconify.design/icon-sets/) is a perfect fit for you.  

Iconify aggregates all the free available open-source icon collections.  You can find pretty much any icon to satisfy your UI needs.  

In addition, it provides instructions and information on usage depending on your framework.

## SVG Silh

Mainly for front-end devs without the means to create custom SVG designs. SVG Silh provides an extensive list of SVGs generated from Pixabay images.  

Its simple and straightfoward, so go [check it out!](https://svgsilh.com/)
