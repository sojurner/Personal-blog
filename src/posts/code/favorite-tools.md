## Intro

There are plenty of amazing & free available tools/resources for developers. Here are some of my favorites.

## VS Code

This is a no-brainer for front-end developers. If you're a dev, and have never heard of VS Code, I strongly advise lifting that rock over your head.

I can go into details of the features and benefits of VS Code, but frankly, I wouldn't be able to do it justice. Not to mention, it would take forever.

All I can say, is [try it out](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and see for yourself.

## Postman

Postman is a popular API client for devs to create, share, test and document APIs. They provide a slew of features that help facilitate every step of the API development process.

Most likely, you'll be using Postman or another similar collaborative API service at your job. So, if you're an upcoming dev, I'd advise [trying it out](https://www.postman.com/) and getting acquainted.

## Brave

     alt="Brave logo"
     style="border-radius: 10px; height: 150px;" />
This is my main, go-to web browser. For me, the main selling point is its built-in ad block feature. In my opinion, this is should be default for any web browser. Tied with the ad blocker, is their rewards program that incentivizes private ad viewership in exchange for BAT coins!

If you're searching for a more privacy based web browser, then Brave is not going to be it. Brave is built off of Google's Chromium software, so privacy will be second-class a feature.

To view their entire feature list head over to [Brave's feature page](https://brave.com/features/).

## Openbase

     alt="Openbase logo"
     style="border-radius: 10px; height: 150px;" />

Openbase is a fantastic web app where users can learn, discover, and rate open-source NPM projects. Personally, I'm a fan of the clean and futuristic UI.

The sheer amount of information and data it provides is enormous. I always feel I'm getting a complete picture of the entire npm ecosystem.

I encourage everyone to [check it out](https://openbase.io/)!

## Mockaroo

     alt="Mockaroo logo"
     style="border-radius: 10px; height: 150px;" />

Mockaroo is a mock data generator website that supports CSV, JSON, SQL, and Excel formats. Its straightfoward and easy for anyone to use, even without a programming background.

For me, its most attractive feature is the expansive list of category types to choose from. Example of some types include: Company Name, Phone number, SSN, Drug Name, etc.

Check out their [website](https://www.mockaroo.com/) to see the full list and start mocking!

## Today I Learned ( HashRocket )

TIL is a great learning resource for programmers. Simply put, its one large series of informative, code-related blog posts.

Each post is short, concise and digestible for any dev on the go. Topics can range anywhere from languages & frameworks to tools & tips/tricks.

## Iconify + SVG Repo

If you're a cheap-ass like myself, [Iconify](https://iconify.design/icon-sets/) & [SVG Repo](https://www.svgrepo.com/) provide an enormouse collection of free open source icons.

You can find pretty much find any vector to satisfy your UI needs.

In addition, they provide instructions and additional guides for usage depending on your framework.

## SVG Silh

Mainly for front-end devs without the means to create custom SVG designs. SVG Silh provides an extensive collection of SVGs converted from Pixabay images.

Its simple and straightfoward, so go [check it out!](https://svgsilh.com/)
