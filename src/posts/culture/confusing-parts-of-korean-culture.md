## Before I Begin...

I had the pleasure of living in Korea from **2013 - 2015**. During that time, I made it a personal goal to *embrace* and *experience* all that the country had to offer with an **open mind**.  In doing so, I learned a great deal about the *societal* & *cultural* norms that dominated its **modern society**. By no means has two years made me an *expert* on this subject matter. But personally, it was enough time to **observe** and come to my **own conclusions**. And so, here are a list of some of Korea's *cultural practices* that had me **scratching my head**.

## The Age Heirarchy

*Age* has unbelievably overbearing power in Korea. Simply being older, means entitlement to unconditional respect, formal addressment, and priority in almost every social and political agenda (opinions, benefits, etc).

I understand the intent and logic behind this culutral practice, but in many ways, it has become an quick, unreliable, and rigid approach to establishing a contextual heirarchy.

To me, its assuming that age and wisdom invariably follow a positive correlation. While being older certainly represents more lived opportunities, actually learning from them is the bridge to the growth and wisdom that deserves respect. Having had opportunites is important, but developing from them should be the line of difference.

## K-Pop & K-Drama

The *Korean entertainment* industry is, behind all of its fluff, just sugar. From a creative perspective, it offers little to no appeal.


Year in and year out, there's virtually been zero artistic variation between *K-pop* songs. They all follow the same formula, reenact the same routine, recite the same lyrics, wear the same outfits, and dance to the same beat. Just listen to one song and you'll have heard all of them.

Unfortunately, K-Dramas are not too far different from their distant cousin. For the most part, every drama series plays out the same diluted, drawn-out, and over-romantacized storyline.

For me, the most unappealing aspect of K-dramas is the lack of true *character development*, and instead overwhelming focus on *relationship development*. Rarely, will the main characters change/grow introspectively, but rather for the sake of the relationship, as a result of circumstances and events that force their hand.

In general, the common thread I see within Korean entertainment that has festered its progression is the reluctance to experiment and adopt new ideas.  The people at the top, who dictate the direction of the industry, often default to safe and proven methods, rather than going for it with different ideas.

I may sound overly critical, but I say this out of hope for a positive reform within the industry.

## The Education System

One of the many blessings that I'm constantly grateful for, is that I've never had to go through the *Korean education system*. There aren't sufficient adjectives to describe its brutal and unforgiving environment. I for sure would not have lasted. Oddly, this devoid of compassion system is all geared towards one test, [수능](https://borgenproject.org/tag/the-suneung/).

![K-nerds](https://koreanstudyblogdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/120.jpg)

*수능 (suneung)* is basically their SAT's but with life implications. Frighteningly, performance on this test will paint the future outlook of the student. It dictates which colleges they can attend, which in turn, determines which jobs they can get, leading to how much they can earn, and ultimately, where in the social ladder they'll be placed. An anecdote from one of my past friends, illustrated a typical day during his high school years:

- 6:30am - wakeup, breakfast
- 8:00am - start of school
- 12:20pm - lunch for 30 min
- 4:20pm - end of school
- 5:00pm - supplemental classes
- 6:00pm - dinner
- 7:00pm - self study (in school) until 9~11pm
- 11:30pm - go home and sleep

The educuation system needs reformation. At this point, its become a one-sided debate. Year after year, [Korea has led in every negative mental health statistic](koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20200427000687). Since 2007, suicide has been the No. 1 cause of death for teenagers. In 2019, 28.2% of middle & high school students reported some form of depression. And the list goes on and on. No matter how the numbers are framed, Korea does not look good.

## The Work Culture
 
In a nutshell, Korea's work culture operates similarly to its age heirarchy, but instead of age, it's company rank.

Those who are higher up in the corporate ladder have so-called *unspoken* priveleges that enable control and **abuse of power** within the group. To a certain extent, people in executive positions who are responsible for final say in company decisions, should receieve a certain level of respect. However, this final say often extends past the work hours, and intrudes upon the employees' personal time.

They will schedule "mandatory" after work gatherings, such as _late dinner at a bar_ or _karaoke night_.  To add to the sulk, these "gatherings" are usually held during the middle of the week, where employees are still required to wake up early the next morning for work.

> These gatherings involve heavy drinking and obsequious gesturing towards superiors, lasting deep into the night.  As you can imagine, these situations become a hotbed for fraternization.

Unfortunately, these gatherings are "mandatory" in the sense that refusal to attend leads to unfavorable consequences that can deeply affect chances of a promotion or raise.

All the friends that I've made during 2013-2015, have grown-up and gotten jobs. Sadly, almost each one hate their lives because of this insepid work culture. They are forced to drink for long hours after a grueling work day, and have little to no choice but to repeat it over and over.

## Plastic Surgery

This has been a controversial subject in Korea for as long as I can remember.  The idea of going under the knife for cosmetic purposes, has slowly been normalized in their society.  To me, this is an issue that stems from insecurity and lack of self-confidence as a result of a socially cutthroat, competitive culture.  Competition is always a plus when its healthy, but in Korea's case, its become  has gone too far and has now breached into mental harm.

If someone is determined to partake in a cosmetic procudure, by all means, they should have freedom of choice to do so.  However, the issue is not whether or not it should be allowed, but rather if normalizing this practice is downplaying deeper, systemic issues within the society.
