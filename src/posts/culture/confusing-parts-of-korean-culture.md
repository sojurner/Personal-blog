## Before I Begin...

I had the fortune of living in Korea from 2013 - 2015. During that time, I enjoyed experiencing all that the country had to offer, and learned alot about the societal & cultural norms that dominated its modern society. Two years doesn't make me an expert on this subject matter, but it was plenty of time for me to observe and come to my own conclusions. And so, here are some aspects of Korean culture that confused the shit out of me...

## The Age heirachy

Age means a great deal in Korean culture. Simply being older, means entitlement to unconditional respect, formal addressment, and priority in most social and political agendas (opinions, benefits, etc).

In many ways, I oppose this age-based value system. To me, its assuming that age and wisdom follow a positive linear correlation. While being older certainly represents more lived opportunities for growth and development, actually learning from them is the bridge to greater insight and wisdom. Having opportunites is important, but improving upon them is the difference.

I support the idea of respect through a meritocracy, which is a strong core American belief.  It's not perfect, but it has developed arguably the most diverse and perhaps one of the richest nations in history.

## KPop & KDrama

The Korean entertainment industry is, at its raw core, just sugar. It's a form consumption that is addicting for certain people while providing little to no personal value to its consumers.

Year in and year out, there's virtually been zero artistic variation between Kpop songs. They all follow the same formula, reenact the same routine, recite the same lyrics, wear the same outfits, and dance to the same beat. Just listen to one song and you'll have heard all of them.

KDramas are not much different.  Its almost always a diluted, drawn-out romance involving two main characters, both with extraordinary situations.  For me, the most unappealing aspect of KDramas is the lack of true character development, and instead heavy focus on relationship development.  Rarely, will the main characters change/develop introspectively, but rather as a result of circumstances and events that force their hand for the sake of the relationship.  

I may sound a little cynical here, but I say this out of desire for a positive revolution in Korean entertainment.

## The Education System

One of the many blessings that I'm constantly grateful for, is that I've never had to go through the Korean education system.  There aren't sufficient adjectives to describe its cut-throat and unforgiving environment.  I for sure would not have lasted.  Oddly, this devoid of compassion system is all geared towards one test (수능).  

수능 (sooneung) is basically their SAT's but with life implications. Frighteningly, performance on this test will paint the future outlook of the student.  It dictates which college they can go to, which in turn determines which jobs they can get, leading to how much they can earn, and ultimately, where in the social heirarchy they'll be placed.  An anecdote from my native friend illustrated a typical day during his high school years:

- 6:30am - wakeup, breakfast
- 8:00am - start of school
- 12:20pm - lunch for 30 min
- 4:20pm - end of school
- 5:00pm - supplemental classes
- 6:00pm - dinner
- 7:00pm - self study (in school) until 9~11pm
- 11:30pm - go home and sleep

The educuation system needs reformation.  At this point, its not even a debatable opinion.  Year after year, [Korea has led in every negative mental health statistic](koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20200427000687).  For starters, since 2007, suicide has been the No.1 cause of death for teenagers.  In 2019, 28.2% of middle & high school students reported some form of depression. And the list goes on and on.  No matter how the numbers are framed, Korea does not look good.  

## The Work Culture
I recently spoke to an close native friend about this, and even he agrees it makes little sense.  In a nutshell, the work culture operates similarly to the age heirarchy, but instead of age, its company rank.  

Those who are higher up in the corporate ladder have greater priveleges that enable control and abuse of power within the group. And rightfully so, people in executive positions are given more responsibilities and should have the final say when it comes to company decisions. But this final say, often extends past the work hours and intrudes upon the employees' personal life.

They'll schedule "mandatory" after work gatherings *(such as dinner at a bar or karaoke night)*. Usually, these will be during middle of the week, where the following morning will be a work day. These gatherings involve heavy drinking and a lot of grovelling & obsequious behavior towards bosses that'll last until midnight.  

As you can imagine, its not very fun.  Definitely, not how I would want to spend my wednesday night. Unfortunately, it is "mandatory" in the sense that refusal to attend leads to consequences that can negatively affect chances of a promotion or raise.

The friends that I've made during 2013-2015, all have jobs, and almost each one hate their lives because of this.  They are forced to drink for long hours after a grueling work day, and have little to no choice but to repeat it over and over.

## Cosmetic Surgery
This has been a controversial subject in Korea for as long as i can remember. Admittingly, I am not aware of their arguments for it.  However, I think many would agree that if you dug deeper, this is an issue that stems from insecurity and lack of self-identity.  I believe that the lack of self-confidence is a result of a socially ruthless competitive culture, in which it's boundaries have extended towards mental harm.  That may very well be a stretch, but frighteningly, its reasonable to assume.

As an American, I'll never have an objection to freedom of choice.  If someone wishes to partake in a cosmetic procudure, by all means, they should.
