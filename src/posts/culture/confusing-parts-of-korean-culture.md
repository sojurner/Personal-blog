For the record, I am of Korean descent, but my appearance is perhaps the only korean thing about me. Having been born and raised in the States, I identifiy with American culture, and prefer friends who align in the same manner. I had the fortune of living in Korea from 2013 - 2015. During that time, I enjoyed experiencing all that the country had to offer as well as learning the current societal & cultural norms that dominated its modern society. Clearly, 2 years doesn't make me an expert on this subject matter, but it certainly was plenty of time to observe and come to my own conclusions. And so, here are some aspects of Korean culture that confused the shit out of me..

## The Age heirachy

Age means a great deal in Korean culture. Simply being older, means entitlement to unconditional respect, formal addressment, and priority in most social and political categories (opinions, benefits, etc).

In many ways, I oppose this age based value system. To me, its miscorrelating a linear value with wisdom. While being older definitely represents more lived opportunities for growth and development, it doesn't necessarily equate greater depth of knowledge and insight. Having opportunites and learning from them is a significant difference.

I think we can all agree that there are plenty of old, cranky, and unpleasant folks out there. They are not what you would consider role models of moral success and exemplary character.

I fall under the belief for respect and decency to be measured on a merocratic system. Meaning, your social value and worth should be tied to your character and personal accomplishments rather than age.

## KPop & KDrama

The Korean entertainment industry is, at its raw core, just sugar. It's a form consumption that is addicting for certain people while providing little to no personal value to its consumers.

There's virtually zero artistic variation amongst KPop idols. They all follow the same formula, reenact the same routine, recite the same lyrics, wear the same outfits, and sport the same hairstyles. If your looking to get into KPop, just listen to one song and you'll have heard all of them.

As for KDramas, the english translated titles are impossibly cringy. here are some from just this past year:

- [Crash Landing on You](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crash_Landing_on_You) - 2020
  - How about [Crash Landing on 9/11]()?
- [It's Okay to Not Be Okay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It%27s_Okay_to_Not_Be_Okay) - 2020
  - Wow, I never thought of it that way. Now I can live my life.
- [Romance is a Bonus Book](https://asianwiki.com/Romance_is_a_Bonus_Book) - 2019
  - Where is this book? Please, I need this book.
- [Guardian: The Lonely and Great God](https://asianwiki.com/Guardian:_The_Lonely_and_Great_God) - 2017
  - Superman: The lonely and Great Kryptonian

I haven't watched or read any spoilers for these dramas, but I bet I could give a generic premise that would describe all of them:

There's usually three or four main characters. Two of them are involved in the "A" storyline where some sort of "one in a million", romantic scenario exists that prevents them from expressing their feelings for one another and thus from being with eachother. Usually, these two characters are the "perfect" male and female. Both tall and attractive with great personalities. Typically, one is in an incredible economic situation (A 5 star hotel manager, or the vice president of a fortune 500 company) while the other is struggling to make ends meet (an ill mother, scammed out of a deal, etc).  The drama will spend months extending the series by adding irrelevant material to the plotline in order to keep the audience interested and ride out the wave of decent viewership ratings.    When an episode gets low numbers, it'll be followed by an outrageous one, where something significant happens that changes the entire direction of the series and potentially shooting themselves in the foot.
