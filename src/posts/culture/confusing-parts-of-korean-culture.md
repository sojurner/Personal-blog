**If you haven't read part 1, none of this is going to make any sense. So, head on over there before continuing!**

## Recap

I am of Korean descent, but my appearance is the only aspect of me that is korean.  I was born and raised in the States, by parents who despite was culturally Korean, fully embraced American culture.  I couple years ago, I had the fortune of living in Korea for two of my four years as US army soldier.  During my time, there was a lot I enjoyed about Korea.  But there were cultural and societal norms that I could not understand.

## The Age heirchy
Age means a great deal in Korean culture.  Well, at least when comparing **your age** relative to the average age of the group.  for example, In a company setting, being older certainly has immense benefits.  Benefits such as being addressed formally and personal opinions and decisions take priority over others.

In contrast, American culture operates more on a merocratic value system.  Meaning, your social value & worth is greater tied to your accomplishments and character rather than age.  

In a sense, I oppose this age based value system.  For me, its miscorrelating age with wisdom. Being older doesn't necessarily equate to higher wisdom and knowledge.  It represents more lived opportunities for growth and development.  But having opportunites and seizing them are different.  In fact that difference is what should be tallied in the value system.
