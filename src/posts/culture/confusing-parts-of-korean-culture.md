## Before I Begin...

I had the pleasure of living in Korea from **2013 - 2015**. During that time, I made it a personal goal to *embrace* and *experience* all that the country had to offer with an **open mind**.  In doing so, I learned a great deal about the *societal* & *cultural* norms that dominated its **modern society**. Clearly, 2 years hasn't made me an *expert* on this subject matter, but it was plenty of time for me to **observe** and come to my **own conclusions**. And so, here are a list of some of Korea's *cultural practices* that had me **scratching my head**.

## The Age Heirarchy

*Age* has unbelievably overbearing power in Korea. Simply being older, means entitlement to unconditional respect, formal addressment, and priority in almost every social and political agenda (opinions, benefits, etc).

I understood the intent and logic behind this culutral practice.  But in many ways, it has felt become an absolute, rigid approach in establishing a contextual heirarchy.

To me, its assuming that age and wisdom invariably follow a positive linear correlation. While being older certainly represents more lived opportunities for growth and development, actually learning from them is the bridge to greater insight and wisdom. Having had opportunites is important, but growing from them should be the line of difference.

## K-Pop & K-Drama

The *Korean entertainment* industry is, behind all of its fluff, just sugar. From a creative perspective, it offers little to no appeal.

Year in and year out, there's virtually been zero artistic variation between *K-pop* songs. They all follow the same formula, reenact the same routine, recite the same lyrics, wear the same outfits, and dance to the same beat. Just listen to one song and you'll have heard all of them.

Unfortunately, K-Dramas are not too far different from their cousin. For the most part, every drama series plays out the same diluted, drawn-out romancantic storyline.  While I can certainly appreciate all the nuances and difficulties of executing a well-designed drama, directors and producers often default to safe and proven methods and rarely experiment with new ideas.

For me, the most unappealing aspect of K-dramas is the lack of true *character development*, and instead overwhelming focus on *relationship development*. Rarely, will the main characters change/grow introspectively, but rather as a result of circumstances and events that force their hand for the sake of the relationship.

I may sound overly critical, but I say this out of hope for a positive reform within the industry.

## The Education System

One of the many blessings that I'm constantly grateful for, is that I've never had to go through the *Korean education system*. There aren't sufficient adjectives to describe its cut-throat and unforgiving environment. I for sure would not have lasted. Oddly, this devoid of compassion system is all geared towards one test, [수능](https://borgenproject.org/tag/the-suneung/).

*수능 (suneung)* is basically their SAT's but with life implications. Frighteningly, performance on this test will paint the future outlook of the student. It dictates which college they can go to, which in turn determines which jobs they can get, leading to how much they can earn, and ultimately, where in the social heirarchy they'll be placed. An anecdote from my native friend illustrated a typical day during his high school years:

- 6:30am - wakeup, breakfast
- 8:00am - start of school
- 12:20pm - lunch for 30 min
- 4:20pm - end of school
- 5:00pm - supplemental classes
- 6:00pm - dinner
- 7:00pm - self study (in school) until 9~11pm
- 11:30pm - go home and sleep

The educuation system needs reformation. At this point, its not even a debatable opinion. Year after year, [Korea has led in every negative mental health statistic](koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20200427000687). For starters, since 2007, suicide has been the No.1 cause of death for teenagers. In 2019, 28.2% of middle & high school students reported some form of depression. And the list goes on and on. No matter how the numbers are framed, Korea does not look good.

## The Work Culture

I recently spoke to an close native friend about this, and even he agrees it makes little sense. In a nutshell, the work culture operates similarly to the age heirarchy, but instead of age, its company rank.

Those who are higher up in the corporate ladder have greater priveleges that enable control and abuse of power within the group. And rightfully so, people in executive positions are given more responsibilities and should have the final say in company decisions. However, this final say often extends past the work hours, and intrudes upon the employees' personal time.

They will schedule "mandatory" after work gatherings, such as _late dinner at a bar_ or _karaoke night_. Usually, these will be during middle of the week, where the following morning will be a work day.

> These gatherings involve heavy drinking and a lot of grovelling & obsequious behavior towards bosses that'll last until midnight.

As you can imagine, its not very fun. Definitely, not how I would want to spend my wednesday night. Unfortunately, it is "mandatory" in the sense that refusal to attend leads to consequences that can negatively affect chances of a promotion or raise.

The friends that I've made during 2013-2015, all have jobs, and almost each one hate their lives because of this. They are forced to drink for long hours after a grueling work day, and have little to no choice but to repeat it over and over.

## Plastic Surgery

This has been a controversial subject in Korea for as long as I can remember.  The idea of going under the knife for cosmetic purposes, has slowly been normalized in their society.  To me, this is an issue that stems from insecurity and lack of self-confidence as a result of a socially ruthless competitive culture, in which it's boundaries have extended towards mental harm.

Admittingly, I'm not entirely versed on the public's argument in support of cosmetic surgery, nor do I care enough to investigate. If someone is determined to partake in a cosmetic procudure, by all means, they should have freedom of choice to do so.
