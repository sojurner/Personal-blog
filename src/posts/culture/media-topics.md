2020 was a very challenging year for everyone. An unexpected, global pandemic has reshaped every nation's economy and forced many people to make undesirable adjustments in order to survive. Despite the reputedly gloomy clouds that surround our near-future outlook, I see a desire within society for a positive shift towards a healthier social discourse. Here are some issues/topics I hope will be given more mainstream attention in 2021.

## Mental Health

Until recent years, mental health was largely considered a taboo subject that was largely overshadowed by more seemingly pressing health concerns such as Cancer and Diabetes. In my opinion, mental health has deeper long-term consequences than any other health issue and should be treated as such.

I believe society's negligence of mental health is due to a lack of reliable research in obtaining a confident understanding and consensus of the human mind.  And in all fairness, because of the uniqueness of each individual, there are potentially infinite factors that can contribute to the overall arbitrary measure of one's mental health.

However, I think the first step to better handling mental health is a less technical approach: a shift in perspective from a disorder to a complication. I'm currently halfway through a book called "[The School of Life: An Emotional Education](https://www.amazon.com/School-Life-Emotional-Education/dp/191289145X/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&keywords=school+of+life&qid=1610069853&sr=8-2)" by Alain de Botton. Without going to deep, the book does a fantastic job of raising awareness to alot of the buried feelings and thoughts that unassumingly influence our present mood and actions.  In a sense, it preaches people to be more accepting and compassionate of others, considering that we are a mystery to ourselves and to those around us. I encourage everyone to read it.

## Commitment to EVs

Recently, theres been a lot of press towards comittment to a cleaner and greener future. Not too long ago, California's governer issued [Executive Order N-79-20](https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.23.20-EO-N-79-20-Climate.pdf) pledging to implement state-wide zero-emission cars by 2035. As a realist, this proclammation seems a bit over ambitious. First and foremost, it would be impossible to enforce without ruffling a lot of feathers. The automobile industry, big oil, and citizens who can't afford an EV will not acquiese easily.

However, my main concern with this whole transition to EVs, is that not everyone is on board. This type of mass scale shift in the industry is going to require collective agreeance and uniform action towards a gas-free future. Proof of concept, which has been overly focused on, is only half the equation. The other half is the need for a charging network (charging stations) on a scale that is comparable to that for gas vehicles (gas stations). This cannot be achieved if everyone is implementing their own super-charging input/output models with no cross-platform compatability.

## Pet Industry Reform

According to [ASPCA](https://www.aspca.org/animal-homelessness/shelter-intake-and-surrender/pet-statistics#:~:text=Approximately%206.5%20million%20companion%20animals,approximately%207.2%20million%20in%202011.), 23% of dogs have at one point or another been through a shelter, while the percentage for cats is 31%.

~25% rate of homelessness amongst cats and dogs seems overly high. Surely, we can do better.

Based off of conversations I've had with other pet owners, there are two main sides of this equation: untethered demand from overzealous pet owners and careless breeders who have prioritized monetary gain over humane and lawful practices. While there's plenty of blame to go around, it doesnt change the bottom line: maturiety towards a more responsible and productive pet society is going to start by:

- Pet owners tailoring their expectations and demands.
- Holding breeders accountable to strict legal standards.

## Politics is Everywhere, All the Time

Politics, in this social media driven era, has rapidly become an attention-seeking narcissist, demanding to be the star in every conversation, issue, and/or topic. Everything has become: this or that, yes or no, good vs evil and us vs them.  Not only is it exhausting, but more importantly, it's wildly unproductive.

The traditional idiom: "Theres a time and place for everything", seemingly has never been more apparent. I hope it can be applied more this year.

## Diet shouldn't be this confusing

I pride myself in personal caretaking of my health and fitness. I make sure I eat right and exercise daily. The problem is, never have i been more confused as to what is considered, the "right way to eat".

There are so many conflicting schools of thought, each with their own cavalcade of rambunctious supporters, all claiming life-changing health results. Personally, I find them all obnoxious and unproductive towards a better uniformal understanding of human diet.  What has made matters worse, is that there seems to be an endless stream of research studies which partially support all sides of this chaotic debate, adding more fuel to the fire.  

## Technology is Progressing Too Fast

Technology has propelled modern society into an inperceivable realm of progress and development. However, for all its glory and immense benefits, it has come at a cost. For the most part, modern technology has been utilized on behalf of financial and social gains instead of civil progress. As a result, it has introduced social media, radically changed the job landscape, and politically weaponized.

I believe social media can hold a positive and beneficial place in our society. However, considering the elevating rates of depression that have grappled the younger generations, it's apparent that we're not yet ready for it. It has generated an inpercievable amount of pressure amongst young adults.
