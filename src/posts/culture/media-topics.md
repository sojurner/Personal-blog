Mainstream media has incredible power and influence over our society. However, what is often reported is not always the most pertinant.  

## Mental Health
Until recent years, mental health was largely considered a taboo subject that carried negative connotation.  Its severity was overshadowed by other more seemingly pressing health concerns such as Cancer and Diabetes.  

Its common to hear people who have been diagnosed of a mental illness to be treated with an anti-depressent.

## Commitment to EVs
Recently theres been a lot of press towards social pledges committing towards a cleaner and greener future.  Not too long ago, California's governer issued [Executive Order N-79-20](https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.23.20-EO-N-79-20-Climate.pdf) in order to implement state-wide zero-emission cars by 2035.  As a realist, this proclammation seems a bit over ambitious.  First and foremost, it would be impossible to enforce without ruffling a lot of feathers.  The automobile industry, big oil, and citizens who can't afford an EV will not acquiese easily. 

Ultimately the main concern with the transition to EVs, is that .  This type of shift in the industry is going to require everyone to pitch in.    ,  which is overwhelmingly dominated by gas fueled cars would not be pleased.  Nor will the millions of american      the traffic industry that powers its economy.  If a changes like this is to be achieved, it's going to demand full committment from all parties

## Pet Industry Reform

This is nothing more than my opinion based off of conversations I've had with other pet owners. According to [ASPCA](https://www.aspca.org/animal-homelessness/shelter-intake-and-surrender/pet-statistics#:~:text=Approximately%206.5%20million%20companion%20animals,approximately%207.2%20million%20in%202011.), 23% of dogs have at one point or another been through a shelter, while the percentage for cats is 31%.  

~25% rate of homelessness amongst cats and dogs seems overly high. Surely, we can do better.

From my deducement , there are two main sides of the equation, untethered demand from overzealous pet owners, and careless breeders who have prioritized monetary gain over humane and law-abidding practices.  While there's plenty of blame to go around, it doesnt change the bottom line: maturiety towards a more responsible and productive society is going to start by tailoring our expectations and demands for pets.  

## Politics is Everywhere, All the Time

Politics clearly deserves a spot in social and national discussions.  Unfortunately, it has become an attention-seeking narcissist, demanding to be the star in every conversation, issue, and/or topic.  The people have drank the koolaid, and now everything has become: this or that, yes or no, good vs evil, us vs them. 

As crazy as this may sound, considering the current political climate, there is alot of truth to the idiom, "Theres a time and place for everything".  Perhaps, we should apply that here.

## Health/Fitness shouldn't be this confusing

I pride myself in caretaking of my health and fitness.  I make sure I eat right and exercise daily.  The problem is, never have i been more confused as to what is considered, the "right way to eat" and the "proper way to exercise".  

On one corner, you find the "vegans" who preach against everything related to animal products, and on the other corner followers of the "ketogenic diet", who support eating primarily animal products. Never have I've seen an instance of two distinctively, opposite schools of thought both claiming to provide the same health result.

But, It doesn't stop there. If "what to eat?" was confusing enough there's also "when to eat?".  intermittent fasting and time-restricted feeding has proclaimed that eating within certain hours of the day is just as important.  While popular idea was eating 5 small meals throughout the day





## Technology is Progressing Too Fast

For all its glory and immense benefits, technology has propelled modern society into an inperceivable realm of progress and development.  However, with all great things, it has come at a cost.
