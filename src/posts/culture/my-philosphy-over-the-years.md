## Undersell yourself

> "_You only get one chance to make *First Impression*_".

While this universal adage certainly speaks truth, it also forces an exorbitant amount of **social pressure** on newcomers to hit homers in their first encounters. This unfortunately, leads to _over-evaluation_ of identity and sets _unrealistic_ expectations.

Now don't mistake _Undersell Yourself_ for **Sell Yourself Short**. _Undersell Yourself_ leans towards the idea that it is strategically advantageous to initially be underevaluated than it is to be overrated. This doesn't necessarily mean to _mislead_, but rather to let people **set their own conclusions** based on the limited information that you provide about yourself. Here is a list of reasons to justify this logic:

- _It serves as a filter to find the right friends_

  New people you meet will be have an _underwhelming sense_ and _incomplete picture_ of you. Those who stick around and still perceive you as a **potential friend**, are the type of friends to pursue.

- _From the start, you'll be trending up_

  You always want to be _trending up_, and underselling yourself from the start will naturally open the opportunity to do so. If you _underperform_, it will be **expected**. If you _exceed_ or even meet expectations, it will come as a **welcome surprise**.

  On the flip side, if you set the bar too high, _underperforming_ will result in a **downward trend**, while _overdelivering_ will be expected.

- _Element of surprise is on your side_

  **Novelty** is the most _coveted_ and _attractive_ quality in nature. It is the best avenue in creating long lasting impressions, and by underselling, it is at your **disposal**. Under low expectations, are vast openings for surprise through overperformance.

- _Your image will more accurately be a reflection of your abilities rather than optics._

  Inevitably, over time, one's **true colors** become _inescapable_ no matter how _ostentatious_ of a **first impression**. By underselling yourself, you enable your **actions** to _speak louder than words_ and as a result present a more authentic and unpretentious image.

## Keep Generosity on a Short Leash

In an era of great _wealth_ and unprecedented standard of living, it has never been easier to be **charitable**. _Generosity_ is a **life-changer** when it touches the right people.

While I am a huge _proponent_ of generosity, at the same time, I refuse to be **exploited**. In other words, I believe in _magnanimity_ through a **fair lens**.

The somber truth about _generosity_, is that because it originates from a place of _understanding_ and _compassion_, it can easily be **taken advantage of** either through _malicious_ intent involving **scammers** & **false charities**, or through _unproductive_ **bureacratic** entities and **freeloaders**.

It's not in my place to _judge_ these people involved, for what perhaps is a _low point_ in their **moral history**. But, it doesn't negate the idea that, if given a choice, I'd prefer to be _excluded_ rather than end up on the **short end of the stick**. Ideally, I'd like my donations to reach the _right_ people in **dire need**.

With that said, I try to keep a _mindful_ attitude to prevent **overcorrection** and refrain from assuming that behind all **charitable endeavors** lies _self-interest_ and _greed_, or underneath every **beggar** is a _moocher_.

For every bad in the world, theres hundreds of _unreported good_. Good is like _air-conditioning_. It's only noticed, when it's not working.

## Surrender the Battle, Win the War

This is a common _aphorism_ that gets lost in the context of goals and life decisions. Personally, I like to reframe it as, "_compromise on daily tasks, but never settle on big goals_".

Its hard _distinguishing_ between **tasks** and **goals**, since it seems most tasks one way or another are _geared towards_ a **goal**. So, _compromising_ on a **task** may feel like _settling_ on the **goal**.

In addition, goals _evolve_ as we age. The sights that we set on as young emerging college graduates, were likely to be _unrealistic_ based on our **unrealized proclivities** at the time. So does this mean _pivoting_ on goals, in a way, is _settling_?

I argue _no_. In fact, I'd go as far to say that **pivoting** is an _important_ element of goal pursuit. The _refusal_ to pivot is being _stubborn_ and is, in itself, **settling on the goal**. Goals should be viewed as general concepts rather than a specific list of details. They should _fluidly_ represent the _aspirational_ nature and pursuit of **higher personal standards**.

As for tasks, these are what we do on a _day to day_ basis. Failing on tasks is arguably necessary. No single task should be considered _utmost essential_ in which _failure_ would be deemed **unacceptable**. This type of attitude leads to _burnout_ and goal settling. Trust me, I've lived through it.

## Find ways to Laugh

As we age, and we become more _culturally and politically indoctrinated_, our ability to laugh **deteriorates**. I've seen the **transformation** in others, as well as within myself. Movies and shows I'd enjoy and laugh to a few years ago, have now become **unwatchable**.

Whether this be the _natural progression_ of the human mind or me insufferably choosing to be _mindfully corrupted_, finding new ways to laugh has never been more **clearly necessary**.

Everyone knows that _laughter_ is the best medicine, but few actually put a _concerted_ effort to **improve** their ability to laugh. This is a weird point to grasp, since laughter is fundumentally _subconscious_. You can't _force yourself_ to **laugh** anymore than you can _force a kid_ to **like broccoli**. If something is funny, you'll laugh _effortlessly_. So, it seems _counter-intuitive_ to have to discover/build new ways for laughter.

Funny is _subjective_. So, whichever **engine** in the subconscious responsible for our varied sense of humor, can be _influenced_. How so, can be perpetually debated, but I fall under the thought that _experiences_ are the main **influencers** amongst genetics and all else.

While experiences are _immutable memories_, they are also _unlived futures_. With that said, sense of humor is a continual **work in progress**, requiring **active pursuit** of _positive_ and _well-intentioned_ experiences.

## Embrace Emotions

In the male community, there has developed a huge _stigma_ against **emotions**. In a nutshell, the _ideal_ male is envisioned to be a _fearless_, _stoic_ **leader** guided purely by _logic_ and _empirical_ evidence. I see this humorously like telling a **lion** to be _vegan_. Its **paradoxical**.

Emotion is baked into our DNA; it's what _drives_ a **human to be a human**. To tell young males to make _emotionless_ decisions, is sending the **wrong message**. As much as we wish for every choice to be driven by _stoic fervor_, **life happens**, and events plays out _unpredictably_ in reality.

I believe, emotions should be _embraced_. They should be _accepted_ for what they are, and likewise, be purposefully _mindful_ of their **effects**. Its _okay_ to have emotions, but its more important to **let go** of them.

## It's you

The modern age of _hyper consumerism_ has conditioned the human psyche to be **exteroceptive**. Consequently, it has convinced ourselves to be inadequate and that the missing piece to our wholesomeness is some form of external input.

There are plenty of examples that illustrate this _emotional hole_ in our society, but perhaps the most popular is that of the old & bored retiree with the shiny, new sports car, in attempt to fill a seemingly endless void.

Similarly, if we're feeling *sad* or *depressed*, we assume we're missing something in our **diet**, or in need of consuming the right **drug** (again, all external sources).

This epidemic of insecurity and sense of lacking, stems from what i see as, an old-world mindset of **seeking external solutions for internal problems**.

In my belief, we are the _destructive reactors to our problems_, as well as, _the powerful mediators of the solution_.

I compare this idea to a room. A **messy room** can be made *clean*, but also, a **clean room** can be turned *messy*. The *condition/outcome* of the room is within the power of the owner, and you are the **owner of your mind**.

Now this isn't intended to be a _Pull yourself up by your Bootstraps_ lecture, but rather a means to *empower* people's perception of their own *strength and will*.
