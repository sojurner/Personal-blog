## Generosity on a Short Leash

In an era of great _wealth_ and unprecedented standard of living, it has never been easier to be **charitable**. _Generosity_ is a **life-changer** when it touches the right people.

While I am a huge _proponent_ of generosity, at the same time, I refuse to be **exploited**. In other words, I believe in _magnanimity_ through a **fair lens**.

The somber truth about _generosity_, is that because it originates from a place of _understanding_ and _compassion_, it can easily be **taken advantage of** either through _malicious_ intent involving **scammers** & **false charities**, or through _unproductive_ **bureacratic** entities and **freeloaders**.

By no means do I _blame society_ for my inability to be openly generous. I am equally guilty of sharing a flawed past, plagued by many character defining moments, where I regrettably came up short. Nonetheless, it doesn't negate the idea that, if given a choice, I'd prefer to be excluded rather than participate and end up with the **short end of the stick**. Ideally, I'd like my donations to reach the _right_ people, and assist those in **dire need**.

With that said, It's important to be _mindful_ of **overcorrection**. We all get burned every now and then, and it's _searingly_ (pun1) tempting, at the _heat_ (pun2) of the moment, to assume that behind most **charitable efforts** lies some form of _self-interest_ and _greed_, or underneath the common street **beggar** is a _moocher_.

For every bad in the world, there are hundreds of _unreported good_. Good is like _air-conditioning_. It's only noticed, when it's not working.

## Surrender the Battle, Win the War

This is a common _aphorism_ that gets lost in the context of goals and life decisions. Personally, I like to reframe it as, "_compromise on daily tasks, but never settle on big goals_".

Its hard _distinguishing_ between **tasks** and **goals**, since it seems most tasks one way or another are _geared towards_ a **goal**. So, _compromising_ on a **task** may feel like _settling_ on the **goal**.

In addition, goals _evolve_ as we age. The sights that we set on as young emerging college graduates, were likely to be _unrealistic_ and socially induced. So, it begs the question, does _pivoting_ on goals classify as _settling_?

I'd argue _no_. In my opinion, **pivoting** is an _important_ element of goal pursuit. The _refusal_ to pivot is being _stubborn_ and is, in itself, **settling on the goal**. Goals should be viewed as general concepts rather than a specific list of details. They should _fluidly_ represent the _aspirational_ nature and pursuit of **higher personal standards**.

As for tasks, these are what we do on a _day to day_ basis. Failing on tasks is arguably necessary. No single task should be considered _utmost essential_ in which _failure_ would be deemed **unacceptable**. This type of attitude leads to _burnout_ and sooner or later, goal settling.

## Undersell yourself

> "_You only get one chance to make a *First Impression*_".

While this universal adage speaks great truth, it also forces an exorbitant amount of **social pressure** on newcomers to hit homers in their first encounters. This unfortunately, can lead to a range of outcomes both favorable and undesirable. The one I'd like to focus on, is the tendency for the audience to _over evaluate_ character and set _unrealistic_ expectations.

Now don't mistake _Undersell Yourself_ for **Sell Yourself Short**. _Undersell Yourself_ leans towards the idea that it is strategically advantageous to initially be underevaluated than overrated. This isn't implying to _mislead_, but rather to keep introductions short, and allow people's general inclination to **set their own conclusions** based on the information they've been provided. Here is a list of reasons to justify this practice:

- _It filters in the right friends_

  New people you meet will be given an _underwhelming sense_ and _incomplete picture_ of you. Those who stick around, despite a lacking presentation, are the type of friends to pursue.

- _From the start, you'll be trending up_

  You always want to be _trending up_, and starting from the bottom will naturally provide the opportunity to do so. If you _underperform_, it will be **expected**. If you _exceed_ or even meet expectations, it will come as a **welcome surprise**.

  On the flip side, if you set the bar too high, _underperforming_ will result in a **downward trend**, while _overdelivering_ will be expected.

- _Element of surprise is on your side_

  **Novelty** is the best avenue in creating long lasting impressions, and by underselling yourself, it leaves plenty to be desired. Under low expectations, you have novelty at your disposal, by utilizing numerous openings of surprise through overperformance.

- _Your image will more accurately be a reflection of your character & abilities._

  Inevitably, over time, one's **true colors** become _inescapable_, no matter how _ostentatious_ of a **first impression**. By underselling, you enable your **actions** to _speak louder than words_ and as a result, present a more authentic image.

## Find ways to Laugh

As we age, and supposedly become more _culturally and politically opinionated_, our ability to laugh **deteriorates**. I've seen the **transformation** in others, as well as within myself. Movies and shows I'd enjoy and laugh to a few years ago, have now become **unwatchable**. Actively finding new ways to laugh has never been more **clearly necessary**.

Everyone knows that _laughter_ is the best medicine, but few actually put a _concerted_ effort to **improve** their ability to laugh. This is a weird point to grasp, since laughter is fundumentally _subconscious_. You can't _force yourself_ to **laugh** anymore than you can _force a kid_ to **enjoy broccoli**. If something is funny, you'll laugh _effortlessly_. So, it seems _counter-intuitive_ to mindfully discover/build new ways for laughter.

Because funny is _subjective_, whichever **engine** in the subconscious, responsible for our varied sense of humor, can be _influenced_. How so, can be perpetually debated, but I fall under the thought that _experiences_ are the main **influencers** amongst genetics and all else.

While experiences are _immutable memories_, they are also _unlived futures_. Which means, your sense of humor is a continual **work in progress**, requiring **active pursuit** of _positive_ and _well-intentioned_ experiences.

## Embrace Emotions

In the male community, there has developed a huge _stigma_ against **emotions**. In a nutshell, the _ideal_ male is envisioned to be a _fearless_, _stoic_ **leader** guided purely by _logic_ and _empirical_ evidence. I see this humorously like training a **lion** to be _vegan_. It's **paradoxical**.

Emotion is baked into our DNA; it's what _drives_ a **human to be a human**. Teaching young males to make _emotionless_ decisions, is sending the **wrong message**. As much as we wish for every choice to be driven by _stoic fervor_, **life happens**, and events plays out _unpredictably_ in reality.

I believe, emotions should be _embraced_. They should be _accepted_ for what they are, and likewise, be purposefully _mindful_ of their **effects**. Its _okay_ to have emotions, but it's more important in understanding when to **let them go**.

## It's you

The modern age of _hyper consumerism_ has conditioned the human psyche to be **exteroceptive**. Consequently, it has convinced ourselves to be inadequate and that the missing piece to our wholesomeness is some form of external input.

There are plenty of examples that illustrate this _emotional hole_ in our society, but perhaps the most recognized, is that of the old & rich retiree with the shiny, new sports car, in attempt to fill a seemingly endless void.

Similarly, if we're feeling _sad_ or _depressed_, we assume we're missing something in our **diet**, or in need of consuming the right **drug** (again, all external sources).

This epidemic of insecurity and sense of lacking, stems from what i see as, an old-world mindset of **seeking external solutions for internal problems**.

In my belief, we are the _destructive reactors to our problems_, as well as, _the powerful mediators of the solution_.

I compare this idea to a room. A **messy room** can be made _clean_, but also, a **clean room** can be turned _messy_. The _condition/outcome_ of the room is within the power of the owner, and we are all **owners of our respective minds**.
