## The Walmart

Oh, Walmart. The place we all go to, but will never admit that we do.  Its cheap, convenient and full of "certain" types of people.  Yes, by "certain", I'm talking about a subset of the population  that were once frowned upon, but now have become archetypes of US culture.  I'm talking about the obese.

If you've never noticed, I encourage you to swing by your local walmart and check it out for yourself.  Its hard to unsee once your aware of the alarming frequency of overweight occurences.  Its led me to wonder why this is the case.  You wouldn't observe the same behavior at a Target, or a Whole Foods.  What about Walmart is appealing to the masses (pun intended)?

First, lets take look at their hallmark slogan: 
- "Save Money. Live Better."

This seems innocent enough.  Focus is on low prices
