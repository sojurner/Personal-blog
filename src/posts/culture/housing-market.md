First off, by no means am I an economist. I am certainly not knowledgable when it comes to the complexities and nuances that influence the housing market. This is strictly, a personal opinion from an aspiring first-time home buyer.

## WTH
Since 2000, the median US household income has risen 50%(45k~63k), while the [average price of a home has doubled (135k~278k)](https://dqydj.com/historical-home-prices/). The number of people that can comfortably afford to buy a decent house has never been lower. Currently, I reside in Colorado, and the average for a 2br, 2ba in my area is 350K.

### 350K?

Anyone with a background in the housing market would bore me a technical explanation to justify the current housing market.  Perhaps, they would attribute the price to a number of factors, such as, rise in demand, population growth, location, etc.  However, simple common sense would suggest that the price is clearly over-inflated.  Is this a result of an untethered demand from acquiescing home-buyers? Or is that really what the houses are truly worth?

In general, many people expect to extend their budget for a home if its a better fit. Plenty of people could justify spending a couple thousands more, perhaps even a couple ten thousands more. But at some point, a line of sense has to be drawn, and alternative options need to be revisited.

Another point I'd like to make is that many millenials like myself, largely feel we've been given the short end of the financial stick.  Specifically, colleges and universities have become absurdly expensive and have financially crippled us with student debt. While, we can argue that taking on student loans was nobody else's decision but our own, its apparent that these huge decisions we're unrightfully tossed in front of us at a young and inexperienced age.  Its a lot to expect a teenager to conduct a financial risk assessment in order to make the reasonable choice.

Oddly enough, the housing market feels eerily similar.  In a sense, both employ similar tactics of social pressure to convince inexperienced individuals to enter massive financial investments.

For me particularly, it has made me wary and reluctant to take on any kind of sizeable debt even if it ends up being profitable.

Fortunately if we're willing to venture out, their are plenty of hidden gem cities across the States waiting to be discovered. One of the more underrated traits of this Country, is its diverse landscape. So many different state/city cultures that provide plenty of different fits for any person to fit in.
