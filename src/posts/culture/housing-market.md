First off, by no means am I an economist. I am certainly not knowledgable when it comes to the complexities and nuances that influence the housing market. This is strictly, a personal opinion from an aspiring first-time home buyer.

## WTF
Since 2000, the median US household income has risen 50%(45k~63k), while the [average price of a home has doubled (135k~278k)](https://dqydj.com/historical-home-prices/). The number of people that can comfortably afford to buy a decent house has never been lower. Currently, I reside in Colorado, and the average for a 2br,2ba is 350K.

### 350K?

WTF is going on? Is this a product of untethered demand from acquiescing home-buyers? Or is that really what houses are worth?

Realtors will tell me that if I did any research I'd realize that the current prices are justified and reasonable.  To that I say: ╭∩╮（︶︿︶）╭∩╮.

In general, I and other people expect to pay extra for a home if its a better fit. Many could justify spending a couple thousands more. But at some point, a line of reasoning has to be drawn, and alternative options need to be reconsidered.

Another thing to note, the millenial generation has been crippled by student debt. I think many peers would agree that in a large sense, we've been financially decieved and taken advantage of by universities. Oddly enough, the housing market feels eerily similar. Both employ similar tactics of social pressure to convince inexperienced individuals into making unsavory financial decisions.
It has made us more wary and reluctant to take on any kind of debt even if it ends up being profitable.

Fortunately if we're willing to venture out, their are plenty of hidden gem cities across the States waiting to be discovered. One of the more underrated traits of this Country, is its diverse landscape. So many different state/city cultures that provide so many different fits for the diverse population.
