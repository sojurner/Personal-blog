## Intro

In many ways, the _human desire_ to be a part of the group, is an overall function of **survival**. This social behavior, popularly termed as _tribalism_, is a primitive psychological mechanism of the human mind to _distinguish_ our realities between **good and evil**.

What has become even more intriguing to me over recent years is the _relative nature_ of human tribalism, which I refer to as **relative tribalism**. My personal definition of relative tribalism is the _steadfast loyalty and allegiance_ to certain belief systems to better fit the **context of the environment**.

## Global Tribalism

To illustrate this point, lets place ourselves within a _global context_ to that of the relationship between **Korea and Japan**. For those who aren't aware, these two nations share a [painful and gut-wrenching past](https://www.lehigh.edu/~rfw1/courses/1999/spring/ir163/Papers/pdf/kwk2.pdf) that has _lingered_ to this day in the form of **bitterness** and **animosity** towards eachother.

From an outsiders perspective, it seems bizarre for two countries with overwhelming cultural and societal _similarities_, to view one another as **enemies**. The _disdain_ and _antagonistic criticism_ has trickled down to current generations, and finds its way into trivial and petty **national disputes**.

In addition, having lived in Korea for 2 years, I've observed first hand, the _shame tactics_ (duty, betrayal, traitorism, etc) that respective societies employ upon their citizens in order to develop a strong sense of **intransigent nationalism**.

## State Tribalism

Taking a step further into a _smaller scope_, and we'll find tribalism within the **state context**.

Imagine a scenario where two college students from _rival universities_ were to somehow meet on a trip in **Europe**. The immediate reaction upon the discovery of eachother, would be a feeling of _welcome suprise_ by the **unlikely odds** of encountering a fellow countryman from the same school system.

However, this positive reception _only exists_ simply because the **setting** (Europe) is _larger_ than the **commonality** (university) that they share. If the scope was _reduced_, let's say, swap the environment from a Europe to San Diego, the mutual bond would flip from one of _affability_ and _cordialness_ to that of **indifference** and **apathy**.

## Infinite Layers

What I've discovered over time, is that the _contextual matrix_ of tribalism are seemingly **endless**. It's an _incredible function_ of the human brain to make sense of **self** and the **reality** that it occupies. It's a _humble reminder_ to us all of the unfathomable **complexities** of our minds.

Perhaps, for me, the most _fascinating aspect_ of all of this, is the awareness of ideas and self that end up in our **blind spots**. These layers of our tribal identities are so _convoluted_ that we have become a **mystery to ourselves**. 

We are more focused on the _flaws_ and _deficiencies_ of our **perceived enemies**, that we're blinded by our **own**, similar **shortcomings**. Our outward criticisms are _projections of our own personal insecurities_, screaming to be **heard and understood**, but, instead are _exacerbated_ by reciprocal, stubborn **finger-pointing**.
