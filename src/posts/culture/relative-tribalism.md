## Intro
Tribalism has been and still is a core component of human nature. I've always percieved it as a phenemon constructed in our minds to rationalize our realities into good and evil. What has become more intriguing to me over recent years is the relative nature of human tribalism.  

What do I mean by relative tribalism?

My personal definition of relative tribalism is the unwavering loyalty and allegiance to certain belief systems within the context of the environment.

To illustrate this point, lets place ourselves on a global context. The most familar and relative example for me, is the relationship between Korea and Japan.  If you aren't aware, these two nations aren't very fond of eachother due to a [turbulant past](https://www.lehigh.edu/~rfw1/courses/1999/spring/ir163/Papers/pdf/kwk2.pdf) that in many ways have lingered to present day.  Its so bizarre, because there are so many cultural and societal similarities that they share, but yet, they see eachother as enemies.  The disdain and innate criticism has trickled all the way down to the individual, and as a result, its common to find petty disputes between citizens of respective countries, simply because of ethnic differences. In this context, the tribal identity is that of a nationalist who by default, must defend against defend their cultural and ethnic values against arbitrary oppositions.  

If we take a step further into a smaller context, global tribalism is replaced by state tribalism.  

Lets say two people from the U.S. both from the same state were to somehow meet on a vacation in Europe.  Upon discovering the commonality, the immediate reaction would be a sense commradery and bonding by the unlikely odds of meeting a fellow american from the same state of residence, thousands of miles away.  However, if we were to swap the location from a foreign country to a smaller scope, lets say Hawaii, oddly, the connection would not feel as significant.

On the flip side, every U.S. citizen will agree that there's plenty of opposition between the states.  Again, you'll find people that will dislike someone simply by being from a opposing state.

In many ways, the human desire to feel a part of the group, is a function of survival.  We tend to look for traits that we share, hobbies  in common

Reddit is a classic example of a hub of untethered tribalism.  Each subreddit has its moderators and members who by and large will protect and defend their intrests and beliefs

What I've discovered is that the contextual layers are seemingly endless.  Its a fascinating function of the human brain that reminds us how complex and intricate our minds really are.
