This is probably going to *strike a nerve* for those stout military **advocates**. This is simply my *opinion* on **Service Dress Uniforms (SDU)**, so please take it as such.  

## Stolen Valor

To begin, I'd like to discuss an *ancillary issue* related to the SDUs, *Stolen Valor*.  For those who have never heard of this term, the [definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_impostor) of *Stolen Valor* is:
> The *act of impostors*, making *false claims* about their military service.

It's fairly easy to spot a **military imposter**, because like this individual above, they're *bad at it*.  While the *uniform* is a clear red flag, his *weight* alone is a tell-all sign.  As for the uniform, aside from the *unkemptness and disarray*, it's nearly impossible for anyone to have that many awards.

## Don't Steal my Valor?

I've never actually encountered a **military imposter**.  I've only seen them through youtube videos and google images.  As far as my "*out of sight, out of mind*" reality is concerned, they are a *myth*.  

As a veteran, even if this type of practice is *commonplace*, I could care less about it.  Granted, having only served 4 short years, I am not as *emotionally invested* in my **military identity** as others.  With that said, accusing this act as "*stealing*" is an **over exaggeration**.  I would say it falls more in the line with "*lying*".

Let's take a step back and apply some sensical judgement. **Valor** isn't some rare substance in a *finite pool*.  It's not as if **imposters** are *stripping* away portions of it meant for other deserving veterans.  It's simply a *social concept* to award those who have **served**.  It's as *plentiful* and *abundant* as our minds make it out to be.  No one is *stealing* from anyone.  

Clearly, **Stolen Valor** isn't what you'd deem as *commendable* behavior, but nor is it as *bad* as it's made out to be.  In fact, I'd argue that the act itself, isn't necessarily *harmful* to anyone else other then potentially, **the imposter's themselves**.

Sure we can make the inarguable point that they're, "**Standing on the Graves of Veterans!**".  However, if we're digging this deep for reasons to *demonize* these trivial individuals, then perhaps we've *lost sight* of more pressing veteran issues, such as **homelessness, depression, and suicide**.

Also, let's not forget that the biggest reason **Stolen Valor** even exists, is because of the **Service Dress Uniforms**.

## Service Dress Uniforms

For the record, I hated my **Service Dress Uniform (SDU)**.  As someone who strongly believes in *function over form*, the **SDU** epitomizes the *polar opposite*.  It's *purely visuals* with its only *functional purpose* (from a military context), as being an **analog for civilian business attire**.

However much I despised the physical SDU, it was the *painstaking, nazi-like* uniform **inspections** that drove me crazy. It is one aspect of the military, I'm glad to be done with.  

To illustrate the absurd commitment towards the SDU, there's an entire **manual** detailing out the exact *positional measurements* for every *ribbon, badge, medal*, and item to be placed on the uniform.

The amount of time I've spent, making these things "**straight**", gives me *partial PTSD* just thinking about it.

In this context, "**straight**" is *relative*.  If the goal is to be "**straight**" as in parallel to the ground, then simple common sense would suggest it to be an *impossible task to achieve*.  

You can't pin something "**straight**" on an article of clothing that is made to fit on the curvature of the upper body.  Its not a *flat surface*; you're dealing with both *depth & height*.  Also, something that is pinned "**straight**" when the jacket is *hanging from a hanger*, won't appear "**straight**" when the jacket is worn on a variably moving human being.

In addition, if it's not by military standards "**straight**", it can *appear* "**straight**" by simply *adjusting* the wear of the jacket (pulling it more towards one side). I've actually tricked people this way, which only further supports the *ridiculousness* of this whole ordeal.

I've gotten into my fair share of trouble, *arguing endlessly* with hardcore **sergeants** about why the SDU is necessary.  The main argument I was constantly *rebutted* against was: 
> It is a timeless *tradition* that revolves around **Paying Attention to Detail**, which translates to *all aspects* of being a service member*.

OK, in that case, why can't it both *serve a purpose* and *be productive*? Other unpopular practices in the military, such as **room inspections** and **overnight duty**, at least offer some form of *productive result* (a cleaned room, surveilance requirements) while serving the *same purpose*.  I fail to see any *productive* output when the **SDUs** are utilized.

## The Costs

Sadly, I've only made personal, nuanced arguments thus far.  Don't forget the *financial aspect* of all this, which I'm sure would **raise plenty of green eyebrows**.

Here is the *cost* of a **Service Dress Uniform** multiplied by the most recent *annual recruitment* numbers for each branch:

- Army: [$500](https://www.armytimes.com/news/your-army/2020/08/11/new-army-service-uniform-will-be-issued-to-recruits-this-winter/#:~:text=The%20new%20uniforms%20will%20cost,Koglin%2C%20an%20AAFES%20merchandise%20manager.&text=All%20the%20new%20uniform%20items,life%2C%20according%20to%20the%20Army) * [80,000 recruits](https://recruiting.army.mil/pao/facts_figures/) ~ **40 million**
- Air Force: [$700](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniforms_of_the_United_States_Air_Force#:~:text=Each%20uniform%20costs%20%24700%20with,to%20personally%20pay%20for%20purchase.) * [55,000 recruits](https://www.airforcetimes.com/news/your-air-force/2019/10/09/air-force-breaks-recruiting-record-in-2019-again/#:~:text=The%20Air%20Force%20surpassed%20its,it%20recruited%20in%20fiscal%202016.) ~ **38.5 million**
- Marine Corp: [$700](http://www.uniforms-4u.com/p-usmc-enlisted-dress-blue-uniform-14463.aspx) * [38,000 recruits](https://www.thebalancecareers.com/things-to-consider-when-choosing-to-join-the-marine-corps-3354338#:~:text=With%20the%20exception%20of%20the,average%2080%2C000%20yearly%20recruiting%20goal.) ~ **26 million**
- Navy: [$650](https://taskandpurpose.com/news/cost-officer-uniforms-demonstrates-gender-inequality-navy/) * [50,000 recruits](https://www.cnrc.navy.mil/pages-nrc-links/nrc-facts-stats.htm) ~ **32.5 million**

These are *gross estimations*. Depending on the **state of national affairs** (war vs peacetime), the number of recruitments could *drastically increase*.  However, I'll stick to "**peacetime**" numbers, since it is the default state.

That means, each year, about **140 million** of tax-payer dollars is being spent on these uni-dimensional uniforms alone.

As much as military tradition is revered in our young nation, is it really worth the arduous costs?
