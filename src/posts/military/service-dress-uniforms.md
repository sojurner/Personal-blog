## Stolen Valor

To begin, I'd like to discuss a _related issue_ related to the servce dress uniform, _Stolen Valor_. For those who are unfamilar with the term, the [definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_impostor) of _Stolen Valor_ is:

> The _act of impostors_, making _false claims_ about their military service.

![stolen valor](https://www.wearethemighty.com/app/uploads/legacy/assets.rbl.ms/17246658/origin.jpg)

It's fairly easy to spot a **military imposter**, because like the person above, they're _bad at it_. Seeing a person in a fake uniform would, understandably, spark outrage for many stalwart veterans. Me on the other hand, I can't help but chuckle.

## Don't Steal my Valor?

I've never actually encountered a **military imposter** in real life. So it's hard to predict how I would react if ever I saw one.

However, even if this type of practice was _commonplace_, I can't help but care none for it. Granted, having only served 4 short years, I am not as _emotionally invested_ in my **military identity** as many others. With that said, accusing this act as "_stealing_" is an **over exaggeration**.

**Valor** isn't some non-fungible asset circulating in a _finite pool_. It's simply a _social concept_ to recognize those who have **served**. It's as _plentiful_ and _abundant_ as our minds make it out to be.

_Stealing_ implies a **+/- transaction**, which in this context, valor meant for true deserving veterans are being stripped away from imposters. In this case, no one is stealing from anyone. Those who rightfully have valor, still maintain it...whatever that means.

Clearly, **Stolen Valor** isn't what you'd deem as _commendable_ behavior, but nor is it as _bad_ as it has been publicized. In fact, I'd argue that the act itself, isn't necessarily being _harmful_ to anyone else other than potentially, **the imposter's themselves**.

Sure, we can make the inarguable _political_ point that they're, "**Standing on the graves of fallen heroes!**". If we're digging this deep for reasons to _demonize_ these trivial individuals, then I'm tapping out. Because at that point, we're shifting focus away from other, more pertinent veteran issues, such as **homelessness, depression, and suicide**.

Lets not forget, the main reason **Stolen Valor** was able to exist, was because of the **Service Dress Uniforms**.

## Service Dress Uniforms

For the record, I hated my **Service Dress Uniform (SDU)**. I, for one, strongly believe in _function over form_, and the **SDU** epitomizes the _polar opposite_. It's _purely visuals_ with its only _functional purpose_ (from a military context) is being an **analog for civilian business attire**.

Be aware, that behind every person in an military service dress uniform was hours, if not days, of **preparation** and _painstaking_ **inspections**, in order to please the public eye. There's a [500pg manual](https://www.army.gov.au/sites/default/files/2020-03/Army%20Dress%20Manual_0.pdf), providing every possible numbing detail about the SDU including the exact _positional measurements_ for every _ribbon, badge, medal_, and/or item to be placed on the uniform.

The SDU is one aspect of the military, I'm glad to never have to partake in again.

## What is Straight?

The amount of time I've spent making the damn ornaments "**straight**", gives me _partial PTSD_ just thinking about it.

The problem I've always had, is that "**military straight**" is _relative_. If the goal is to be "**straight**" as in parallel to the ground, then from my experience, it's an _impossible task to achieve_.

<img src="https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.army.mil%2Fe2%2Fimages%2Frv7%2Funiforms%2Funiform_closeups_service_coat.jpg&f=1&nofb=1"

You can't pin something "**straight**" on an article of clothing that is made to fit on the curvature of the upper body, especially when its pinned on two sides. Its not a _flat surface_; you're dealing with both _depth & height_. Something that is pinned "**straight**" when the jacket is _hanging from a hanger_, won't appear "**straight**" when the jacket is worn on a moving human being.

I've gotten into my fair share of trouble, _arguing endlessly_ with **sergeants** about the necessity of the SDU. Perhaps a clear red flag, that a military career wasn't for me. Despite my stubborn millenial efforts, the main argument I was constantly _rebutted_ against was:

> It is a timeless _tradition_ that revolves around **Paying Attention to Detail**, which translates to _all aspects_ of being a service member\*.

OK, in that case, why can't it both _serve a purpose_ and _be productive_? Other unpopular customs in the military, such as **room inspections** and **overnight duty**, at least offer some form of _productive result_ (a cleaned room, surveilance requirements) while instilling the same _paying attention to detail_ practice. The only "_productive_" output I see with SDUs is for **recognition and tradition**, which again further clashes with my _function over form_ preference

## The Costs

While all this talk about SDUs is nice, I have yet to mention the most controversial aspect for anything miltary related: the financial costs. Below is the _cost_ of a **Service Dress Uniform** multiplied by the most recent _annual recruitment_ numbers for each service branch:

- Army: [\$500](https://www.armytimes.com/news/your-army/2020/08/11/new-army-service-uniform-will-be-issued-to-recruits-this-winter/#:~:text=The%20new%20uniforms%20will%20cost,Koglin%2C%20an%20AAFES%20merchandise%20manager.&text=All%20the%20new%20uniform%20items,life%2C%20according%20to%20the%20Army) \* [80,000 recruits](https://recruiting.army.mil/pao/facts_figures/) ~ **40 million**
- Air Force: [\$700](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniforms_of_the_United_States_Air_Force#:~:text=Each%20uniform%20costs%20%24700%20with,to%20personally%20pay%20for%20purchase.) \* [55,000 recruits](https://www.airforcetimes.com/news/your-air-force/2019/10/09/air-force-breaks-recruiting-record-in-2019-again/#:~:text=The%20Air%20Force%20surpassed%20its,it%20recruited%20in%20fiscal%202016.) ~ **38.5 million**
- Marine Corp: [\$700](http://www.uniforms-4u.com/p-usmc-enlisted-dress-blue-uniform-14463.aspx) \* [38,000 recruits](https://www.thebalancecareers.com/things-to-consider-when-choosing-to-join-the-marine-corps-3354338#:~:text=With%20the%20exception%20of%20the,average%2080%2C000%20yearly%20recruiting%20goal.) ~ **26 million**
- Navy: [\$650](https://taskandpurpose.com/news/cost-officer-uniforms-demonstrates-gender-inequality-navy/) \* [50,000 recruits](https://www.cnrc.navy.mil/pages-nrc-links/nrc-facts-stats.htm) ~ **32.5 million**

To be clear, these are _gross estimations_. Depending on the **state of national affairs** (war vs peacetime), these figures can be drastically different.

With that said, based on _gross estimations_, about **140 million** of tax-payer dollars is being spent annually on nothing but these uni-dimensional uniforms.

In our current _socio-economic_ landscape, there's been a constant growing disdain of the public against big, greedy corporations who have prioritized monetary gains over moral values. Ironically, in this situation, the polar opposite is occuring.
