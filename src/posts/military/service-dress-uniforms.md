## Stolen Valor

To begin, I'd like to discuss an *ancillary issue* related to the SDUs, *Stolen Valor*.  For those who have never heard of this term, the [definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_impostor) of *Stolen Valor* is:
> The *act of impostors*, making *false claims* about their military service.

![stolen valor](https://www.wearethemighty.com/app/uploads/legacy/assets.rbl.ms/17246658/origin.jpg)

It's fairly easy to spot a **military imposter**, because like the person above, they're *bad at it*.  While there's all sorts of mistakes with his *uniform*, his *weight* alone is a huge red flag. Aside from the noticeable *unkemptness and disarray*, it's nearly impossible for anyone to have that many awards.

## Don't Steal my Valor?

I've never actually encountered a **military imposter**.  As far as my "*out of sight, out of mind*" reality is concerned, they are a *myth*.

As a veteran, even if this type of practice is *commonplace*, I could care less about it.  Granted, having only served 4 short years, I am not as *emotionally invested* in my **military identity** as many others.  With that said, accusing this act as "*stealing*" is an **over exaggeration**.

**Valor** isn't some non-fungible asset circulating in a *finite pool*. It's simply a *social concept* to recognize those who have **served**.  It's as *plentiful* and *abundant* as our minds make it out to be.  Stealing implies that the valor meant for true deserving veterans are being stripped away by these imposters.  No one is *stealing* from anyone.  

Clearly, **Stolen Valor** isn't what you'd deem as *commendable* behavior, but nor is it as *bad* as it's publicized in the military.  In fact, I'd argue that the act itself, isn't necessarily being *harmful* to anyone else other than potentially, **the imposter's themselves**.

Sure we can make the inarguable *political* point that they're, "**Standing on the Graves of Veterans!**".  However, if we're digging this deep for reasons to *demonize* these trivial individuals, then perhaps we're losing focus on the more pertinent veteran issues, such as **homelessness, depression, and suicide**.

Also, the only reason **Stolen Valor** can even exist, are because of the **Service Dress Uniforms**.

## Service Dress Uniforms

For the record, I hated my **Service Dress Uniform (SDU)**.  As someone who strongly believes in *function over form*, the **SDU** epitomizes the *polar opposite*.  It's *purely visuals* with its only *functional purpose* (from a military context), as being an **analog for civilian business attire**.

However much I despised my uncomfortable SDUs, it was the *painstaking, nazi-like* uniform **inspections** that drove me crazy. It is one aspect of the military, I'm glad to be done with.  

To illustrate the depth of commitment the military has towards the SDU, there's an entire **manual** detailing out the exact *positional measurements* for every *ribbon, badge, medal*, and item to be placed on the uniform.

## What is Straight?

The amount of time I've spent, making these things "**straight**", gives me *partial PTSD* thinking about it.

The problem is that "**military straight**" is *relative*.  If the goal is to be "**straight**" as in parallel to the ground, then from my experience, it's an *impossible task to achieve*.  

You can't pin something "**straight**" on an article of clothing that is made to fit on the curvature of the upper body, especially when its pinned on two sides.  Its not a *flat surface*; you're dealing with both *depth & height*. Something that is pinned "**straight**" when the jacket is *hanging from a hanger*, won't appear "**straight**" when the jacket is worn on a moving human being.

In addition, if it's not by military standards "**straight**", it can *appear* "**straight**" by simply *adjusting* the wear of the jacket (pulling it more towards one side). I've actually tricked people this way, which only further supports the *ridiculousness* of this whole ordeal.

I've gotten into my fair share of trouble, *arguing endlessly* with hardcore **sergeants** about why the SDU is necessary.  Perhaps a clear sign, that a military career wasn't for me.  The main argument I was constantly *rebutted* against was:
> It is a timeless *tradition* that revolves around **Paying Attention to Detail**, which translates to *all aspects* of being a service member*.

OK, in that case, why can't it both *serve a purpose* and *be productive*? Other unpopular customs in the military, such as **room inspections** and **overnight duty**, at least offer some form of *productive result* (a cleaned room, surveilance requirements) while instilling the same *paying attention to detail* practice.  The only "*productive*" output I see with SDUs is **recognition and tradition**, which appears more *unnecessary* when considering the **financial costs**.

## The Costs

Here is the *cost* of a **Service Dress Uniform** multiplied by the most recent *annual recruitment* numbers for each branch:

- Army: [$500](https://www.armytimes.com/news/your-army/2020/08/11/new-army-service-uniform-will-be-issued-to-recruits-this-winter/#:~:text=The%20new%20uniforms%20will%20cost,Koglin%2C%20an%20AAFES%20merchandise%20manager.&text=All%20the%20new%20uniform%20items,life%2C%20according%20to%20the%20Army) * [80,000 recruits](https://recruiting.army.mil/pao/facts_figures/) ~ **40 million**
- Air Force: [$700](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniforms_of_the_United_States_Air_Force#:~:text=Each%20uniform%20costs%20%24700%20with,to%20personally%20pay%20for%20purchase.) * [55,000 recruits](https://www.airforcetimes.com/news/your-air-force/2019/10/09/air-force-breaks-recruiting-record-in-2019-again/#:~:text=The%20Air%20Force%20surpassed%20its,it%20recruited%20in%20fiscal%202016.) ~ **38.5 million**
- Marine Corp: [$700](http://www.uniforms-4u.com/p-usmc-enlisted-dress-blue-uniform-14463.aspx) * [38,000 recruits](https://www.thebalancecareers.com/things-to-consider-when-choosing-to-join-the-marine-corps-3354338#:~:text=With%20the%20exception%20of%20the,average%2080%2C000%20yearly%20recruiting%20goal.) ~ **26 million**
- Navy: [$650](https://taskandpurpose.com/news/cost-officer-uniforms-demonstrates-gender-inequality-navy/) * [50,000 recruits](https://www.cnrc.navy.mil/pages-nrc-links/nrc-facts-stats.htm) ~ **32.5 million**

These are *gross estimations*. Depending on the **state of national affairs** (war vs peacetime), the number of recruitments could be *drastically higher*.  However, I'll stick to "**peacetime**" numbers, since it is the most likely default state.

That means, each year, about **140 million** of tax-payer dollars is being spent soley on these uni-dimensional uniforms.

In our current *socio-economic* landscape, there's been a constant growing disdain of the public against big, greedy corporations who have prioritized monetary gains over moral values.  Ironically, in this situation, the polar opposite is occuring.
