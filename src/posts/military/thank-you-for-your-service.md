## My Military Past

I served *4 years* in the US Army as a **Combat Medic**. During my time, I was stationed in **Camp Walker** _(대구 / South Korea)_ and **Lyster Army Health Clinic** _(Fort Rucker / AL)_.

After completing my initial enlistment back in 2017, I was officially considered a **Veteran**.

## Me a Veteran?

In many ways, I felt unworthy and undeserving of carrying the **Veteran** label.

For starters, I served only *4* **non-combat** years. It's *minuscule* compared to the majority, who have done **double digit** years, along with **multiple tours** of duty.

In addition, the term *"Veteran"* implies **experience**, **insight**, and **wisdom**. These were qualities I felt I *lacked* as a 25 year-old at the time, who was still *unsure* on a **career path**.

For the most part, I prefer to be *discreeet* about my short **military past**.  While it was an *incredible chapter* in my life, it certainly was not going be my **most defining**.

## My awkwardness exemplified

My *"Veteran"* status would end up being a talking point in alot of normal, casual conversations. Usually, the *first thing* someone mentions when they learn of my **Veteran status** is:  

*"Thank you for your service"*.

This statement generates an *awkward standstill*, where no response can be adequately **sharp** or **genuine**. It always ends up being cringey.

Here are the responses I've come up with over the years:

- *"Your welcome?"*
- *"Thank you ... for thanking me?"*
- *"I appreciate that, thank you."*
- *"I didn't really do shit, but nontheless, I appreciate the gesture."*
- *"No need, the real heroes are still serving."*

**Let's break these down one by one:**

*"You're welcome?"*

- They say its always polite to follow up a **"Thank you"** with **"You're welcome"** . But, thats usually this case in the context of a favor or a task well-done.

*"Thank you ...(for thanking me)?"*

- I've actually said this a few times. **Do not recommend**.

*"I appreciate that, thank you."*

- This would be my go to move. It's still a **bit awkward**, since I'm thanking them for their thanks.  But, at least there's a **buffer** in between.

*"I didn't really do much, but nontheless, I appreciate the gesture."*

- This is what I really **want** to say, but probably **never will**.

*"No need, the real heroes are still serving."*

- I'd have to be at a **Country Club** to say something like this.

## Its a job, not a sacrifice

Any way you slice it, *thanking someone* for a *past job* is **weird**. While some may *argue against* its label as a **"job"**, serving in the military is just like any other full-time position in the workforce.

Like a normal job, there's a *fixed* annual **salary**, roughly the *same* number of **vacation days** rewarded yearly, and *working hours*, for the most part, are *scoped* to the **weekdays**.

*"Thank you for your service"* insinuates **sacrifice**, which to me, is defined by the *intent* of giving up something without any *expectation* of personal **gain/benefit**.

Being or having been a service member doesn't meet this *criteria*, because *benefits and pay* are *contractual obligations* that were signed up for in exchange for **time and service**.

And lets not forget, military service is voluntary.  A *mass conscription* hasn't been in effect since the **Vietnam War**. Granted, the circumstances of the service shouldn't necessarily add/reduce weight to the **sacrifice** argument. But, under the terms of a draft, **Thank you for your service** would have a different, but substantial connotation.

## Conclusion

I've grown to realize that *"Thank you for your service"* is less about recognizing one's past contributions, and more about **establishing a social connection**.

In that sense, I have *no objection*. But, it's still **awkard**.
