## So a bit of history about me...

I served 4 years in the US Army as a **Combat Medic**.

During my time, I was stationed in **Camp Walker** _(대구 / South Korea)_ and **Lyster Army Health Clinic** _(Fort Rucker / AL)_.

I finished my 4 year contract back in 2017, and from then was officially considered a **veteran**.

## Me a Veteran?

In many ways, I felt unworthy of carrying the **Veteran** label.

I served only 4 non-combat years. It dwarfs in comparison to the majority who've done double digit years of service, along with multiple tours of duty.

In addtions, the term **Veteran** implies experience, insight, and wisdom. These were qualities I felt I lacked as a 25 year-old at the time, who was still unsure on a career path.

## My awkwardness exemplified

To avoid social awkward interactions, I try to be discrete about my military past.

Almost always, the first thing someone tellsme when they learn of my **Veteran** status is:  
**"Thank you for your service, sir"**.

I have yet to think of a sharp, genuine response to this remark. It always ends up being awkward.

Here are the best responses, I've been able to come up with over the years:

- **"Your welcome?"**
- **"Thank you ... for thanking me?"**
- **"I appreciate that, thank you."**
- **"It's all bullshit."**
- **"No need, the real heroes are still serving."**

Let's break these down one by one:  
**"Your welcome?"**

- This would be the brain fart response. You're always suppose to say **"Your welcome"** after a **"Thank you"**. But, it makes no sense in this context.

**"Thank you ... for thanking me?"**

- I've actually said this a few times. Do not recommend.

**"I appreciate that, thank you"**

- This would be my go to move. I'm still thanking them for the thanks, but at least theres a buffer in between.

**"It's all bullshit"**

- This is what I really want to say, but probably never will.

**"No need, the real heroes are still serving"**

- Its the last item on this list for a reason. Its too cheesy for my taste.

## Its a job, not a sacrifice

Nonetheless, its weird to be thanking someone for a past job. And yes, it is a job. It's a job just like any other in the workforce, but with additional quirks.

Just like a normal job, there's an annual salary, 30 days of leave granted every year, and work hours (can vary depending on where you're stationed, tour of duty, etc.) for the most part are scoped to the weekdays.

**"Thank you for your service"** insinuates **sacrifice**, which to me, is defined by the intent of giving up something without any expectation of personal gain/benefit.

Being or having been a service member doesnt meet this criteria, since benefits and pay are contractual obligations in exchange for time and service.

Not to mention, its voluntary. A mass **conscription** hasn't been in effect since the Vietnam War. Granted, the circumstances of the service shouldn't necessarily add weight to the **sacrifice** argument. But, in that case, **Thank you for your service** would have a different but still substantial connotation.

## Conclusion

I've grown to realize that **"Thank you for your service"** is less about recognizing one's past contributions, and more about **establishing a social connection**.

In that sense, I have no objection. But its still awkard af.
