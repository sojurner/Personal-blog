## My Military Past

I served _4 years_ in the US Army as a **Combat Medic**. During my time, I was stationed in **Camp Walker** _(대구 / South Korea)_ and **Lyster Army Health Clinic** _(Fort Rucker / AL)_.

After completing my initial enlistment back in 2017, I was officially considered a **Veteran**.

## Me a Veteran?

In many ways, I felt unworthy and undeserving of carrying the **Veteran** label.

For starters, I served only _4_ **non-combat** years. It's _minuscule_ compared to the majority, who have done **double digit** years, along with **multiple tours** of duty.

In addition, the term _"Veteran"_ implies **experience**, **insight**, and **wisdom**. These were qualities I seemingly _lacked_ as a 25 year-old at the time, who was still _uncertain_ on a **career path**.

For the most part, I prefer to be _discreet_ about my short **military past**. While it was an _incredible chapter_ in my life, it was certainly not going be my **most defining**.

## My Awkwardness Exemplified

My _"Veteran"_ status would end up being a talking point in alot of normal, casual conversations. Usually, the _first thing_ someone mentions when they learn of my **Veteran** status is:

_"Thank you for your service"_.

This gesture generates an _impossibly awkward standstill_, where no response can be adequately **sharp** or **genuine**. It always ends up being cringey.

Here are the responses I've come up with over the years:

- _"You're welcome?"_
- _"Thank you ... for thanking me?"_
- _"I appreciate that, thank you."_
- _"I didn't really do much, but okay."_
- _"No need, the real heroes are still serving."_

**Let's break these down one by one:**

_"You're welcome?"_

- They say its always polite to follow up a **"Thank you"** with **"You're welcome"** . But, thats usually the case in the context of completing a favor.

_"Thank you ...(for thanking me)?"_

- I've actually said this a few times. **Do not recommend**.

_"I appreciate that, thank you."_

- This would be my go to move. It's still a **bit awkward**, since I'm thanking them for their thanks. But, less so due to a **buffer** in between.

_"I didn't really do much, but okay."_

- This is what I really **want** to say, but probably **never will**.

_"No need, the real heroes are still serving."_

- The day I join a **Country Club** is the day I'll say this.

## Its a Job, Not a Sacrifice

Any way you slice it, _thanking someone_ for a _past job_ is **weird**. While some may _argue against_ its label as a **"job"**, serving in the military is just like any other full-time position in the workforce.

Like a normal job, there's a _fixed_ annual **salary**, roughly the _same_ number of **vacation days** granted yearly, and _working hours_, for the most part, are _scoped_ to the **weekdays**.

_"Thank you for your service"_ insinuates **sacrifice**, which to me, is defined by the _intent_ of giving up something without any _expectation_ of personal **gain/benefit**.

Being or having been a service member doesn't meet this _criteria_, because _benefits and pay_ are _contractual obligations_ that were agreed upon in exchange for **time and service**.

And let us not forget, modern military service is voluntary. A _mass conscription_ hasn't been in effect since the **Vietnam War**. Granted, the circumstances of the service shouldn't necessarily add/reduce weight to the **sacrifice** argument. However, under the terms of a draft, **Thank you for your service** would have a different, but substantial connotation.

## Conclusion

I've grown to realize that _"Thank you for your service"_ is less about recognizing one's past contributions, and more about **establishing a social connection**.

In that sense, I have _no objection_. But, it's still **awkard**.
