## So a bit of history about me...

I served 4 years in the US Army as a **Combat Medic**.

During my time, I was stationed in **Camp Walker** _(대구 / South Korea)_ and **Lyster Army Health Clinic** _(Fort Rucker / AL)_.

I finished my 4 year contract back in 2017, and from then was officially considered a **veteran**.

## Me a Veteran?

In many ways, I felt unworthy of carrying the **"Veteran"** label.

I served only 4 non-combat years. Its minuscule compared to the majority, who do double digits in years, along with multiple tours of duty.

In addition, the term **Veteran** implies experience, insight, and wisdom. These were qualities I felt I lacked as a 25 year-old at the time, who was still unsure on a career path.

For the most part, I try to be discrete about this four-year military past.  While it was an incredible chapter in my life, it certainly was not going to be my most defining.

## My awkwardness exemplified

My **"Veteran"** status would end up being a talking point in alot of normal converstions that startoff innocently. Usually, the first thing someone tells me when they learn of my **Veteran** status is:  

**"Thank you for your service, sir"**.

I have yet to think of a sharp, genuine response to this remark. It always ends up being awkward.

Here are the responses I've come up with over the years:

- **"Your welcome?"**
- **"Thank you ... for thanking me?"**
- **"I appreciate that, thank you."**
- **"I didn't really do shit, but nontheless, I appreciate the gesture."**
- **"No need, the real heroes are still serving."**

Let's break these down one by one:  
**"Your welcome?"**

- This would be the brain fart response. They say its always polite to follow up a **"Thank you"** with **"Your welcome"** . But, thats usually said in the context of a favor or a task well-done.

**"Thank you ... for thanking me?"**

- I've actually said this a few times. Do not recommend.

**"I appreciate that, thank you"**

- This would be my go to move. It's still a bit awkward, since I'm thanking them for their thanks.  But at least, theres a buffer in between.


**"I didn't really do shit, but nontheless, the gesture is appreciated."**

- This is what I really want to say, but probably never will.


**"No need, the real heroes are still serving"**

- I'd have to be at a Country Club to say something like this.

## Its a job, not a sacrifice

Its weird to be thanking someone for a past job. And yes, it is a job. It's one just like any other in the workforce, but with additional quirks.

Like a normal job, there's an annual salary, 30 vacation days every year, and work hours (can vastly vary) for the most part, are scoped to the weekdays.

**"Thank you for your service"** insinuates **sacrifice**, which to me, is defined by the intent of giving up something without any expectation of personal gain/benefit.

Being or having been a service member doesn't meet this criteria, since benefits and pay are contractual obligations in exchange for time and service.

Not to mention, its voluntary. A mass **conscription** hasn't been in effect since the Vietnam War. Granted, the circumstances of the service shouldn't necessarily add weight to the **sacrifice** argument. But, in that case, **Thank you for your service** would have a different, but still substantial, connotation.

## Conclusion

I've grown to realize that **"Thank you for your service"** is less about recognizing one's past contributions, and more about **establishing a social connection**.

In that sense, I have no objection. But its still awkard.
