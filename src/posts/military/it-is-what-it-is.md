## What does it Mean?

According to [Dictionary.com](https://www.dictionary.com/e/slang/it-is-what-it-is/). **It is what it is** is an idiomatic phrase to illustrate the immutable nature of an object or circumstance.

This was by far the most commonly used phrase in the Army.

Understandably so, due to the sheer size and complexity of the military, there are bound to be inefficiencies. And No matter how frustrating or helpless a situation was, the go to response from leadership was almost always:

**"It is what it is"**.

## What does it Actually Mean?

In the literal sense, Dictionary's definition is 100% spot on. It is accepting the situation as it is.

But what is the conveyed message of this phrase?

- Deal with it?
- Tough luck?

My interpretation was:

- We could choose to focus on how things should be, or accept things as they were and instead focus on what could be done.

Based on my interpretation, I was a fan of this solution-oriented mindset, and even began using it to reinforce its message.

## Maybe It means something different?

My interpretation began to shift, when I started hearing the phrase used a little too frequently and in a different context.

Often I'd hear it in personal conversations, as part of long rants, containing series of complaints, followed by **It is what it is**.
