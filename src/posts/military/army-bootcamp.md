I began my wild journey in the *US Army* back in Feb 27, 2013, when i was shipped off to bootcamp in **Fort Jackson, SC**.  At the time, i was *21 years young*, without a clue in the world of what was to come. The first week, which is referred to as *Reception* was a huge shock to my system.  I'll go into detail my *experience* and lay out some *pointers* for those prospective soon-to-be privates to survive this week long ordeal. It has been awhile since then (8 years) and things may very well be different today, so take it for what it is..

## Reception

To put things into perspective, I had *zero experience/interaction* with anything military related up until my arrival at Fort Jackson.  I really did not know what to expect.  So when I had arrived and was first introduced to the concept of a *Drill Sergeant*, my world was flipped upside down.  If you come from a similar *sheltered background*, **brace yourself**, because the environment and atmosphere will break you down mentally.  *Privacy* and *personal space* no longer **exist**, *sleep deprivation* is the new **norm**, and every sentence out of your mouth has to be *carefully constructed* or else it will come at an **undesirable cost**.

The *Reception period*, was and still is, without a doubt, the **worst week** of my life. In a nutshell, it is *4-5 days* of **in-processing**.  You'll be assigned to a *platoon* of *40-50* other **privates**, and travel as one group between various stations to:

- Fill out and sign paperwork/documentation
- Recieve military uniform and equipment
- Shave your head (if your a guy)
- Health/fitness evaluation
- Briefings and instructions on various Military guidelines
- and many other boring stuff i can't recall

## Sleep-Depriving Drill Sergeants

Depending on the station, it can take anywhere from *5-20 minutes* per person person. If you extrapolate that to *40-50 people* per group, it can end up taking numerous hours.  And since you're required to travel as a *group*, you have no choice but to wait like a robot until the very **last person** finishes.  You're not allowed to *converse* amongst your peers, and most importantly 
you cannot be caught *dozing off* for reasons I'll go into later.  

The only voices you'll hear are *screaming* and *cursing* from drill sergeants at an **inexplicable** level.  Think of every possible *insult* you've received in your life and *multiply* it by **100**.  It's important to to develop some *thick skin* in preparation for this.

Personally, my biggest challenge during this time was **sleep deprivation**.  I averaged about *2 hours* of sleep each night during this stretch.  What made matters worse was the *swarm of drill sergeants* surveying each platoon like a *hawk*, in delight hopes to catch anyone showing the slightest sign of **dozing off**.  If one person was *caught*, the entire group of the individual **paid the price**.  Usually the punishment would be some form of *tedious labor* during **sleeping hours**.  In hindsight, the drill sergeants themselves weren't necessarily *scary*, but rather the *fear of ostracization* is what made the entire process **impossibly stressful**.

## The Cold

There was a *particular morning* on the second or third day, which I recall vividly as the **lowest** i had ever felt.  It was *5am* with temperatures that hovered around **20°F (-7.2°C)**.  Presumably, we had a long day ahead of us, so we were instructed to get *breakfast* early out of the way.  Apparently, 100 other groups had the same plan, and so the *D-FAC (Dining Facility)* was **packed**, at 5am.  When our group had got there, a **Black Friday** sized line had already formed.  

> We had not yet been issued our official *military attire* and so none of us were *properly clothed* for the **cold**.  It took about *two hours* before we reached the *inside* of the building.  During the two hours, we stood silently in *single file formation*, while the **piercing frigid winds** drove through us from all directions.  It was *impossible* to focus on anything else other than the **sheer cold**.  It was an *insufferable experience*.

## Parting Advice

Everyone's experience with reception is going to more or less be **unique**.  However, by enlisting in the military, we all share a *common trait*: **a desire and hunger for new experiences**.  My best piece of advice for those young *padawans* is to **expect the unexpected**.  *Embrace* the all aspects of the military, even reception, as they come.  In doing so, trust that *hindsight* will prove these moments to be *integral* in **developing a better you**.
