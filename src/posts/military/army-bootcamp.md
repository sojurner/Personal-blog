I began my wild journey in the *US Army* back in Feb 27, 2013, when i was shipped off to bootcamp in **Fort Jackson, SC**.  At the time, i was *21 years young*, without a clue in the world of what was to come. The first week, which is known as *Reception*, was a huge shock to my system.  I'll go into detail my *experience*, and lay out some *pointers* for those prospective soon-to-be privates to better survive this week long ordeal.

## Reception

To put things into perspective, I had *zero* experience/interaction with anything military related up until my arrival at Fort Jackson.  I really did not know what to expect.  And so, when I was first introduced to the concept of a *Drill Sergeant*, my small little world flipped upside down.  If you're like me, coming from a *sheltered background*, please **brace yourself**, because the environment and atmosphere will break you down mentally.  Once you enter those gates, *privacy* and *personal space* no longer **exists**, *sleep deprivation* will become your new **norm**, and every sentence out of your mouth has to be *carefully constructed* or else it will come at an **undesirable cost**.

The *Reception* period, was and still is, without a doubt, the **worst week** of my life. In a nutshell, it is *5-6 days* of nothing but **in-processing**.  You'll be assigned to a *platoon* of *40-50* other **privates**, and travel as one group between various stations in order to:

- Fill out and sign paperwork/documentation
- Recieve military uniform and equipment
- Shave your head (if your a guy)
- Health/fitness evaluation
- Briefings and instructions on various Military guidelines
- And plenty of other boring stuff before the actual training begins

## Sleep-Depriving Drill Sergeants

Depending on the station, it can take anywhere from *5-20 minutes* per person. If you extrapolate that to *40-50 people* per platoon, you're looking at an exporbitant amount of time waiting.  And since you're required to travel as a *group*, you have no choice but to helplessly sit in silence, until the very **last person** finishes.  You're not allowed to *converse* amongst your peers, and most importantly, you cannot be caught *dozing off* for reasons I'll go into later.  

The majority of voices you'll hear are those of *screaming* and *cursing* drill sergeants at an **inexplicable** level.  Think of every possible *insult* you've received in your life and *multiply* it by **100**.  I advise developing some *thick skin* to prepare for this.

Personally, the biggest challenge was **sleep deprivation**.  During this stretch, I averaged about *2 hours* of rest each night, all while dealing with *swarms of screeching drill sergeants* hawkishly surveying each platoon, in hopes of catching someone **dozing off**.  If one person was *caught*, the entire group **paid the price**, and the currency would be in the form of sleep: typically, some form of *tedious labor* during **night hours**.  In retrospect, the drill sergeants themselves weren't necessarily *scary*, but rather the *fear of ostracization* and possibly losing the little freedom you had, made the entire process **impossibly stressful**.

## The Cold

There was a *particular morning* on the second or third day, which I recall vividly as the **lowest** I had ever felt.  It was *5am* with temperatures that hovered around **20°F (-7.2°C)**.  Presumably, my platoon had had a long day ahead, so we were instructed to get *breakfast* early out of the way.  Apparently, 100 other groups had the same plan, and so, by the time we arrived to the *D-FAC (Dining Facility)*, a **Black Friday** sized line had already formed.  

> At that point, We had not been issued our official *military attire*, and so none of us were *properly clothed* for the **weather**.  It took about *two hours* before we reached the *inside* of the building.  During the two hours, we stood zombishly in *single file formation*, while the **frigid winds** pierced through our bodies us from all directions.  It was *impossible* to focus on anything else other than the **soul-crushing coldness**.

Get used to the cold, because one way or another, you'll encounter plenty of similar insufferable experiences.

## Parting Advice

Everyone's experience at reception is going to be more or less **unique**. The best piece of advice I can offer for the young *padawans* is to **expect the unexpected**.  *Embrace* all aspects of the military, even reception, as they come.  In doing so, trust that *hindsight* will prove these moments to be *integral* in **developing a better you**.
